                            <p>As in all TTRPGs, characters are the building blocks of any game in Natural Progression. The characters, or from a certain point of view, the players who play the characters, drive a campaign forward, and their decisions can not only impact a campaign itself, but the world that the campaign is set in.</p>
                            <p>This page describes character abilities and skills, providing a breakdown of each ability and what it represents, as well as the skills associated with each ability.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">Abilities and Skills</h1>
                            <p>All characters have stats that represent their proficiencies in general - fortitude, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, charisma.</p>
                            <p>Unlike other TTRPG’s that have both a modifier and a stat, in Natural Progression, modifiers and stats are one and the same. A character’s ability score is the same as their modifier. Likewise, there is no such thing as a proficiency bonus - each skill has it’s own modifier and can be increased naturally throughout gameplay.</p>
                            <p>Any modifiers a character gets to abilities should be applied to all skills within associated with the ability. For example, a player who has acquires a +2 to their Fortitude should increase their Atheletics, Constitution, Endurance and Mental Fortitude modifiers.</p>
                            <p>The tabs on this page are organized by ability, and the skills of each ability are listed and described within each tab.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Skill Check Calculations</h2>
                            <p>When you are asked to make a skill check, use the following formula:</p>
                            <p>1d20 + skill modifier + other modifiers (generally 0)</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Saving Throws</h2>
                            <p>Some abilities and spells, rather than mentioning a skill check, call for a skill Saving Throw. A Saving Throw is a specific type of skill check that is used in response to something affecting your character.</p>
                            <p>This does mean that an ability that can only be used on a check for a given skill, say Athletics, can also be used when rolling an Athletics Saving Throw.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Passive Skill Checks</h2>
                            <p>Passive skill checks can be used for a check to determine what a character notices or portrays when they are not actively doing something that would require a check. Passive skill checks are calculated as follows:</p>
                            <p>1 + skill modifier + other modifiers</p>
                            <p>For example, Passive Perception would be calculated as:</p>
                            <p>1 + Peception skill modifier + other modifiers</p>
                            <p>A good way to separate the idea of passive checks compared to active checks is that a passive check is a character’s baseline knowledge of something. It is the equivalent of rolling a natural 1 on the skill check.</p>
                            <h3 class="text-center py-1">An Example</h3>
                            <p>Suppose that a character has a magical item with unknown effects. A character with a high passive Perception would notice that there are markings on this item, while a character with a high passive Arcana would know that these markings are magical runes.</p>
                            <p>However, in order to find out what these runes do, a character would have to succeed on an Arcana check or find someone who would know what the runes are, which may require a Persuasion or Tradition check.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">Performing Skill Checks Within a Game</h1>
                            <p>When a check is needed, a player should roll a d20 and add their ability modifier, skill modifier and other modifiers (this will likely be 0) to the roll. Should this total equal or surpass the Difficulty Class of the check, the player succeeds.</p>
                            <p>On a roll of a natural 20, the character a figured out a new technique, or improved upon their old technique and their skill modifier increases by 1, up to a limit of 11. Learning does take time, so only one skills modifier can be increased in this manner per rest. For actions that have no roll of your own associated with it, but instead have a Saving Throw, the target rolling a natural 1 can be used to increase your associated modifier.</p>
                            <p>This limit of one increase per day and situation extends to weapons, spellcasting modifiers and tools as well. The does mean that these four categories each have a separate counter. The first natural 20 (assuming the associated modifier is not maxed out already) will increase the skill, tool or weapon modifier, and any other natural 20 for that section rolled that day will not increase the associated modifier. Therefore, a player could increase 4 different modifiers by 1 each day -- one skill, spellcasting, tool and weapon modifier</p>
                            <p>It should be noted that there should be no such thing as an “Ability check” - a player should never roll a Fortitude check. Rather, they should roll a skill check that is most related to the activity, whether it be Athletics, Constitution, Endurance or Mental Fortitude.</p>
                            <p>This does mean that there is no way for a character to increase their base ability modifiers outside of their Background, Class, Culture or Race. This is 100% intentional; ability modifiers are meant to represent a character’s natural strengths and weaknesses with their given Background, Class, Culture and Race.</p>
                            <p>For more information on these four items, please refer to the Character Creation part of this site.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">An In-Depth Example</h2>
                            <p>Suppose that a character with an Intimidation modifier of 6 under no magical effects or injuries would like to attempt to get information out a bandit that they just captured by threatening them.</p>
                            <p>Their Lore Master calls for an Intimidation check, and to the player’s delight, they roll a natural 20. Their skill check is 20 + 6 (skill modifier) + 1 (from increasing the modifier) + 0 (other modifiers), for a total of 27. This passes the Difficulty Class of 20 set by the Lore Master, and the bandit yields the information that they have.</p>
                            <p>If the player had not rolled a natural 20, and instead rolled an 11, their skill check total would have been 11 + 6 (skill modifier) + 0 (other modifiers), for a total of 17</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">Training</h1>
                            <p>Sometimes, the dice give many natural 20s, and on other days, they give more natural 1s. In order to help combat a player’s luck from impacting a character’s progression, characters can train at a skill in order to improve their modifiers.</p>
                            <p>Characters must receive their training from an individual with a higher modifier than their own for the specified skill. The trainer can be another party member, or an NPC that the party (potentially) hires.</p>
                            <p>A character can train for up to 8 hours a day. While training they cannot focus on any other tasks. Once a character hits 100 hours trained, their skill modifier increases by 1, and their hour count resets to 0 hours. If a character’s training for a day goes over 100 hours, the remainder wraps around to the next level, assuming the trainer still has a higher modifier than you after you increase yours.</p>
                            <p>A character can work on multiple skills at a time. Should a character roll a natural 20 on a skill check while they have hours trained and have not increased a skill modifier since their last rest, their skill modifier will increase like normal and their hours of training will reset to 0 hours.</p>
                            <p>Training can also be applied to weapon and tool modifiers as well, with the same restrictions listed in this section.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">Optional Variants</h1>
                            <p>Listed below are some optional variants of the abilities and skills rules. These rules tend to have (slightly) more complexity than the base rules, and as such, are not for all parties.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Abilities and Skills Optional Rule 1: Modifier Maximum</h2>
                            <p>For players that enjoy having larger (or smaller) modifiers, the skill modifier limit can be modified. A suggested increased modifier maximum is 21.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Abilities and Skills Optional Rule 2: Ability Modifiers</h2>
                            <p>Given that ability modifiers are representing a character’s natural strengths and weaknesses, a group may choose to separate ability modifiers from skill modifiers, tallying the two totals separately. Ability modifiers would still never be increased outside of character creation, but a character's modifier to a roll could exceed 11 assuming their skill modifier is 11 (maxed out using standard rules), and their ability modifier for the skill is nonzero.</p>
                            <p>This rule changes all skill roll calculations to add both the ability and skill modifier totals to a roll, rather than just the skill modifier total.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Abilities and Skills Optional Rule 3: Variable Ability Modifiers</h2>
                            <p>When determining the ability modifier, the used ability does not have to be the pre-defined one as dictated in this section.</p>
                            <p>This does mean that players will need to calculate their ability and skill modifiers separately from each other. As such, it is recommended that if using this option rule, to also use Abilities and Skills Option Rule 2: Ability Modifirs.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Abilities and Skills Optioanl Rule 4: Forgetting Training</h2>
                            <p>For every week between training sessions for a specific skill, a character will lose 8 hours of training, decreasing to a minimum of 0 hours.</p>

                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fortitude" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="fortitude" tabindex="0">
                            <p>Fortitude represents a characters strength, both physical and mental. The following are skills based upon Fortitude:</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Athletics</h2>
                            <p>Athletics is the main ability that reflects a character’s physical prowess. Its general usage is for whenever a character is doing a short term activity or something that would require a great deal of strength, such as jumping a large gap, scaling a tall building or attempting to stop an individual from tackling them.</p>
                            <p>A character with a high Athletics modifier would likely have large muscles, or at the very least, appear fit and toned.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Constitution</h2>
                            <p>Constitution is the ability representing a character’s ability to resist disease and other physical ailments or injuries. As such, it is the ability that directly affects a character’s hitpoints. Constitution may be used to determine if a character is affected by a poison that they ingested, or if an attack leaves them wounded.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Endurance</h2>
                            <p>Endurance is the other ability that reflects a character’s physical prowess. Unlike Athletics, Endurance is used whenever a character is doing a physical activity for an extended period of time. As such, Endurance directly affects how many attacks a character can evade before exhaustion starts to in. Some examples include travelling at an increased rate or participating in a multi-stage tournament or performing.</p>
                            <p>A character with a high Endurance modifier would likely have a toned body, similar to how an Atheletic character would look, but without the larger muscles.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Mental Fortitude</h2>
                            <p>Mental Fortitude is represents exactly what is sounds like - a character’s ability to withstand mental stress, trauma and attacks. Mental Fortitude may be used to determine if a player is affected by mind control or the death of a companion.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="dexterity" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="dexterity" tabindex="0">
                            <p>Dexterity represents a character’s reflexes and ability to perform physical activies that require precision rather than brute force. The following are skills based upon Dexterity:</p>
                            <hr>

                            <p>Acrobatics is the final ability that reflects a character’s ability to perform phyisical tasks in general. Acrobatics represents a character’s ability to do balance related tasks - should a task require some form of strength to perform, Acrobatics should not be used to determine if they are successful. That task should fall to Athletics or Endurance then.</p>
                            <p>Some examples of activities that a character might perform acrobatically include walking across a tightrope or descending down a steep hill.</p>
                            <p>A character with a high Acrobatics modifier would likely appear toned and fit in general, but not show great strength like one might expect from a character with a high Athletics modifier.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Reflex</h2>
                            <p>Reflex represents a character’s ability to react to surprising situations, such as an ambush or a villain who was thought to be dead reappearing. Depending on the nature of a combat, Reflex may be used to determine initiative rolls.</p>

                            <p>Sleight of Hand represents a character’s ability to perform small precise movements with their hands. This ability is not only used when a character is attempting to steal something, but also when playing most instruments or when playing a card game.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Stealth</h2>
                            <p>Stealth represents a character’s ability to get small and low to the ground. Some of examples of when Stealth may be used include when a character is attempting to follow an individual without being noticed or when attempting to make oneself small to follow a culture’s customs. Depending on the nature of a combat, Stealth may be used to determine initiative rolls.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>Arcana represents a character’s ability to understand magic. Arcana may be used to determine the effects of a magic item or to known what spell a character is casting from their words and actions.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>History</h2>
                            <p>History represents a character’s knowledge of factual events and their memory of their experiences. Some examples include knowning the name and outcome of a conflict between to nations or remembering the name of a merchant with which the character recently interacted.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Investigation</h2>
                            <p>Investigation represents a character’s ability to search for a particular object and to recognize when an object would not be able to be discovered in the area. Some examples include searching an office for political papers, looking for traps in a dungeon, or recognizing a draft coming from a wall being indicative of a hidden door.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Medicine</h2>
                            <p>Medicine represents a character’s understanding of the body and practices that can be used to help one heal. Some usages of Medicine include knowing the severity of an injury and knowing how to treat an injury.</p>

                            <p>Deception represents a character’s ability to lie.

                            <p>Performance represents a character’s ability to perform a task for others. This skill check may be paired with another skill check to see how well said skill is performed.</p>
                            <p>For example, if a character is walking across a tightrope during a circus event, they would have to make both a Performance and Acrobatics check. The Acrobatics check would dictate how well the walked across the tightrope, and the Performance check would define how entertaining their action was.</p>
