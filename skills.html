                            <p>As in all TTRPGs, characters are the building blocks of any game in Natural Progression. The characters, or from a certain point of view, the players who play the characters, drive a campaign forward, and their decisions can not only impact a campaign itself, but the world that the campaign is set in.</p>
                            <p>This page describes character abilities and skills, providing a breakdown of each ability and what it represents, as well as the skills associated with each ability.</p>
                            <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">Abilities and Skills</h1>
                            <p>All characters have stats that represent their proficiencies in general - fortitude, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, charisma.</p>
                            <p>Unlike other TTRPG’s that have both a modifier and a stat, in Natural Progression, modifiers and stats are one and the same. A character’s ability score is the same as their modifier. Likewise, there is no such thing as a proficiency bonus - each skill has it’s own modifier and can be increased naturally throughout gameplay.</p>

                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fortitude" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="fortitude" tabindex="0">
                            <p>Fortitude represents a characters strength, both physical and mental. The following are skills based upon Fortitude:</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Athletics</h2>
                            <p>Athletics is the main ability that reflects a character’s physical prowess. Its general usage is for whenever a character is doing a short term activity or something that would require a great deal of strength, such as jumping a large gap, scaling a tall building or attempting to stop an individual from tackling them.</p>
                            <p>A character with a high Athletics modifier would likely have large muscles, or at the very least, appear fit and toned.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Constitution</h2>
                            <p>Constitution is the ability representing a character’s ability to resist disease and other physical ailments or injuries. As such, it is the ability that directly affects a character’s hitpoints. Constitution may be used to determine if a character is affected by a poison that they ingested, or if an attack leaves them wounded.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Endurance</h2>
                            <p>Endurance is the other ability that reflects a character’s physical prowess. Unlike Athletics, Endurance is used whenever a character is doing a physical activity for an extended period of time. As such, Endurance directly affects how many attacks a character can evade before exhaustion starts to in. Some examples include travelling at an increased rate or participating in a multi-stage tournament or performing.</p>
                            <p>A character with a high Endurance modifier would likely have a toned body, similar to how an Atheletic character would look, but without the larger muscles.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Mental Fortitude</h2>
                            <p>Mental Fortitude is represents exactly what is sounds like - a character’s ability to withstand mental stress, trauma and attacks. Mental Fortitude may be used to determine if a player is affected by mind control or the death of a companion.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="dexterity" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="dexterity" tabindex="0">
                            <p>Dexterity represents a character’s reflexes and ability to perform physical activies that require precision rather than brute force. The following are skills based upon Dexterity:</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Acrobatics</h2>
                            <p>Acrobatics is the final ability that reflects a character’s ability to perform phyisical tasks in general. Acrobatics represents a character’s ability to do balance related tasks - should a task require some form of strength to perform, Acrobatics should not be used to determine if they are successful. That task should fall to Athletics or Endurance then.</p>
                            <p>Some examples of activities that a character might perform acrobatically include walking across a tightrope or descending down a steep hill.</p>
                            <p>A character with a high Acrobatics modifier would likely appear toned and fit in general, but not show great strength like one might expect from a character with a high Athletics modifier.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Reflex</h2>
                            <p>Reflex represents a character’s ability to react to surprising situations, such as an ambush or a villain who was thought to be dead reappearing. Depending on the nature of a combat, Reflex may be used to determine initiative rolls.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Sleight of Hand</h2>
                            <p>Sleight of Hand represents a character’s ability to perform small precise movements with their hands. This ability is not only used when a character is attempting to steal something, but also when playing most instruments or when playing a card game.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle" data-toc-skip>Stealth</h2>
                            <p>Stealth represents a character’s ability to get small and low to the ground. Some of examples of when Stealth may be used include when a character is attempting to follow an individual without being noticed or when attempting to make oneself small to follow a culture’s customs. Depending on the nature of a combat, Stealth may be used to determine initiative rolls.</p>
