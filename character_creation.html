                    <p>Each character is created from four main categories: their Background, Culture, Class and Race.</p>
                    <p>First think about what race you want your character to be. Do you want them to be an immortal and fair Elf? Or are they a more down to earth Dwarf?</p>
                    <p>Next, think about what your character did prior to their time adventuring to choose a Background. Were they a woodcarving artisan, or were they a miner?</p>
                    <p>Third, consider why your character began adventuring, or what skills you would like your character to focus on. This will help you decide upon a Class. Are they hunting a bandit who stole something, or perhaps they are searching for the most beautiful jewel?</p>
                    <p>Finally, ponder on the values, strengths and weaknesses of the people your character is from to determine your character’s Culture. You will likely be working with your Lore Master to determine a Culture that is representative of your character’s people. Are your people fair and wise, placing to good of the all people over their own, but prone to missing the plight of mortals? Are they good-hearted and strong, with no stronger bond than their family, but more stubborn than anything in the world?</p>
                    <p>Once you have decided upon one Background, Culture, Class and Race, work with your Lore Master to add any modifications that they may have. Once this has been finished, enjoy your campaign!</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Abilities and Skills</h2>
                    <p>As noted in the Abilities and Skills page, there will never be a check on your Ability, but will always be a Skill check for a specific Skill within an Ability - any modifiers a character gets to abilities should be applied to all skills within associated with the ability. For example, a player who has acquires a +2 to their Fortitude should increase their Atheletics, Constitution, Endurance and Mental Fortitude modifiers.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, keep in mind that before you start applying any bonuses to Abilities (in other words, bonuses to all Skills within an Ability) and Skills, your modifier for each skill is +0.</p>
