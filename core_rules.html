                    <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">Assumptions and Terminology</h1>
                    <p>This section will maintain any assumptions and terminology defintions to help the reader understand the rules defined within this webpage</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">The Lore Master (LM)</h2>
                    <p>As with any other TTRPG, Natural Progressions has one player running the game, while the rest are characters within the game. This player, called the Lore Master, has the final say over any call or rule in the game.</p>
                    <p>This means that it is perfectly viable to play the game by ignoring many of the rules outlined in this document - the game is meant to be tailored to each group’s unique preferences.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-center my-3">Why Lore Master?</h3>
                    <p>Most other TTRPGs use the term Game Master (GM) or Dungeon Master (DM) to refer to the person running the game. Lore Master is intentionally chosen over other terms as that is their primary role, to know (and potentially create) the lore used in the campaign.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes during gameplay, a character may have advantage or disadvantage on a skill check. This may arise in a wide array of circumstances, but the effect of each remains constant.</p>
                    <p>A character that has advantage on a skill check should roll a d20 twice and choose the higher of the two rolls when determining the d20 part of the skill check.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, a a character that has disadvantage on a skill check should roll a d20 twice and choose the lower of the two rolls when determining the d20 part of the skill check.</p>
                    <p>When rolling with either advantage or disadvantage, the skill modifier increase from rolling a natural 20 on the d20 check is only applied should roll that the character uses be that natural 20 - if a character has advantage, their skill modifier will increase only if they roll a natural 20 and they have not hit the skill modifier limit.</p> 
                    <p>If a character has disadvantage their skill modifier will increase only if they roll two natural 20s and they have not hit the skill modifier limit.</p>   
                    <p>Advantage and disadvantage are not stackable; this is no such thing as having double advantage or being a double disadvantage. However, advantage and disadvantage are opposites, so they do cancel each other out. If a character has advantage from two different sources, but only on source of disadvantage, one advantage would cancel with the disadvantage, and the character would still have advantage from the “leftover” source of advantage.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Specific Over General</h2>
                    <p>Many of the rules outlined in this document regarding gameplay, or even character creation, may conflict with one another. Whenever there is any such conflict, refer to whatever rule is more specific.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Round Down</h2>
                    <p>Unless otherwise stated in a description, whenever you have to divide a number while playing, round down, regardless of what decimal you have left over.</p>
