                            <p>Acharacter’s Race should represent their physical characteristics, and should be something that any character, NPC or PC, could figure out by a quick glance at yours. Your character’s race should not quantify what your character values, where they are from, or any of their personal preferences - those should be shaped by their Culture, Background and Backstory.</p>
                            <p>Mechanically, any Race is possible - the most important things are that it fits into the setting and that your Lore Master is ok with your Race. This page will both provide the general rules to follow when Homebrewing your own Races and provide some official Races.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h1 class="text-center py-3 bg-danger-subtle">General Sections</h1>
                            <p>Directly after the name of the Race, there will be a short description giving a basic overview of their racial traits. There also may be some references to a stereotypical Culture for the race, but that can be ignored if your player’s Culture does not follow those stereotypes.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Names</h2>
                            <p>Following the general description of the race will follow the general rules and some example names for individuals of the Race. These are not hard rules, and can be ignored if you wish.</p>
                            <h2 class="text-center py-2 bg-warning-subtle">Traits</h2>
                            <p>Every races has 4 “bonuses” between their ability modifier increases and their unique traits. For instance, the Dwarven race on the next page has a +2 to their Fortitude ability modifier (counts as 2 bonuses), a +1 to their Charisma modifier (counts as 1 bonus), as well as the Dwarven Toughness trait (counts as 1 bonus).</p>
                            <p>Many of these traits may vary by Culture - if they do, refer to the entry in your character’s Culture rather than those in the Race.</p>
                            <p><b>Ability Modifier Increases: </b>This section will list what abilities get increased by the Race, and by how much. The total sum of the Ability modifier increase will not exceed 4.</p>
                            <p><b>Age: </b>This section will list both the general age at which individuals of the Race reach adulthood and their typical lifespan. The age at which an individual comes of age may vary by adulthood, but the typical lifespan rarely does.</p>
                            <p><b>Languages: </b>This section will list what languages an individual of this Race can speak and write.</p>
                            <p><b>Senses: </b>A Race’s senses are compared to what humans generally experience.</p>
                            <p><b>Size: </b>Each race has an average size - both in height and weight. This dictates what size rating they have. Most races will be Medium. There can be variation in the average height and weight, but not size rating.</p>
                            <p><b>Speed: </b>This will define the base speed at which a Race can walk in combat. This trait will not vary by Culture.</p>
                            <p><b>Combat Training: </b>This section will give starting modifiers for specific types of weapons. Generally the bonuses will be a +1 bonus to 3 types of weapons.</p>
                            <p><b>Magic Bonuses: </b>This section will give modifiers to specific types of magic, or allow characters to start with certain spells learned. This bonus will be at most +1 to two types of magic.</p>
                            <p><b>Tool Bonuses: </b>This section will give modifiers to specific tools, and may give starting tools to characters. Generally the bonuses will be a +1 bonus to 4 tools.</p>
                            <p><b>Additional Traits: </b>If the total of the Race’s Ability Modifier increases does not equal 4, there will be one trait for each “missed” Ability modifier increase - for instance, if a Race only has a sum of +2 to their Ability modifiers, there will be 2 abilities at the end of the racial traits section.</p>

                            <p>The Races listed above may not cover the character that you wish to play. What if you want to play a Half-Elf (Elf and Human), or a Dwarfling (Dwarf and Halfling)? Rather than creating your own Race, you can use the following rules for getting Race stats of mixed character.</p>
                            <p>Note that these rules are meant for Races that are half one Race and half of a second. If you want to create a character having more than 2 Races in their descent (such as a child of a Half-Elf and Dwarfling pairing), choose two of the original Races and use those when creating your Race. Likewise, only Races of one size larger or smaller can be created - a pairing of a Medium and a Small race is allowed, but not one of a Tiny and Medium.</p>

                            <p>The names of a half-race will generally follow one or both of the parent races.</p>

                            <p><b>Ability Modifier Increases: </b>From each parent, a Half-Race inherits both a Primary Ability Modifier Increase and a unique trait. If you choose not to inherit unique trait (or the parent Race does not have any), your Half-Race also gets the Secondary Ability Modifier Increase of that parent Race. Refer to the below table to determine the Primary and Secondary Ability Modifier of each race:</p>

                                <thead>
                                    <tr>

                            </table>
                            <p><b>Age: </b>Pick one of the adulthood ages of your parent Races and use that as your Race’s age of adulthood. For your Race’s expected lifetime, either pick one of your parent Races’ expective lifetime, or average it out. If one parent Race is Elves, only choose between your parent Races’ expected lifetime.</p>
                            <p><b>Languages: </b>Your character should speak all languages that their parent Races speak.</p>
                            <p><b>Senses: </b>Any special senses that your parent Races share should be present. For instance, if your character is the offspring of a Dwarf and an Elf, your Dwelf Race should have Darkvision for up to 60 feet.</p>
                            <p>If you character’s parent Races have different senses, confer with your Lore Master to determine which of the conflicting senses should be used.</p>
                            <p><b>Size: </b>Just like age, pick either the one of your parent Races’ heights and weights, or average it out. When determining your size, if both of your parent Races have the same size, use that size. Otherwise, confer with your Lore Master to determine which size should be used.</p>
                            <p><b>Speed: </b>If your parent Races’ base walking speed matches, use that speed. Otherwise, confer with your Lore Master to determine what base walking speed should be used. It is likely that your Race’s speed will match your Race’s size.</p>
                            <p><b>Combat Training: </b>You get half of the combat training bonuses from the combined total of each race. You can choose any combination of the bonuses up to half of the total, meaning that you can only take bonuses from one parent race.</p>
                            <p><b>Magic Bonuses: </b>You get half of the magic bonuses from the combined total of each race. You can choose any combination of the bonuses up to half of the total, meaning that you can only take bonuses from one parent race.</p>
                            <p><b>Tool Bonuses: </b>You get half of the tool bonuses from the combined total of each race. You can choose any combination of the bonuses up to half of the total, meaning that you can only take bonuses from one parent race.</p>
                            <p><b>Additional Traits: </b>A Half-Race can receive up to one unique trait from each parent. If a parent Race does not have one unique trait, or you do not want to take one of their traits, you can instead take the Race’s Secondary Ability Modifier Increase. Refer to the below table listing the possible unique traits that each parent Race has.</p>
