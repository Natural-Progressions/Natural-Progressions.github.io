##### A TTRPG System by SirRunner
}}

\page

# Introduction to Natural Progressions
Hello, and welcome to Natural Progressions. This system is focused on gradual increases in power and role-playing in general - it is not burdened by power increases happening in a tradition step-fashion (i.e. each character is the same power until a level up). Rather, characters gradually increase in power as they "learn" new skills and strategies.
:
This means that this system is well suited to handling long running campaigns, especially those that rely upon role playing and skill checks. Conversely, this system lacks for shorter campaigns (such as one-shots) or games that focus more heavily on combat or other items that contain fewer skill checks or role-play.

### The Lore Master (LM)
As with any other TTRPG, Natural Progressions has one player running the game, while the rest are characters within the game. This player, called the Lore Master, has the final say over any call or rule in the game.
:
This means that it is perfectly viable to play the game by ignoring many of the rules outlined in this document - the game is meant to be tailored to each group's unique preferences.

#### Why Lore Master?
Most other TTRPGs use the term Game Master (GM) or Dungeon Master (DM) to refer to the person running the game. Lore Master is intentionally chosen over other terms as that is their primary role, to know (and potentially create) the lore used in the Campaign.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes during gameplay, a character may have advantage or disadvantage on a skill check. This may arise in a wide array of circumstances, but the effect of each  remains constant.
:
A character that has advantage on a skill check should roll a d20 twice and choose the higher of the two rolls when determining the d20 part of the skill check.
:
Conversely, a a character that has disadvantage on a skill check should roll a d20 twice and choose the lower of the two rolls when determining the d20 part of the skill check.
:
When rolling with either advantage or disadvantage, the skill modifier increase from rolling a natural 20 on the d20 check is only applied should roll that the character uses be that natural 20 - if a character has advantage, their skill modifier will increase only if they roll a natural 20 and they have not hit the skill modifier limit.
:
If a character has disadvantage their skill modifier will increase only if they roll two natural 20s and they hae not hit the skill modifier limit.
:
Advantage and disadvantage are not stackable; this is no such thing as having double advantage or being a double disadvantage. However, advantage and disadvantage are opposites, so they do cancel each other out. If a character has advantage from two different sources, but only on source of disadvantage, one advantage would cancel with the disadvantage, and the character would still have advantage from the "leftover" source of advantage.

### Specific Over General
Many of the rules outlined in this document regarding gameplay, or even character creation, may conflict with one another. Whenever there is any such conflict, refer to whatever rule is more specific.

### Round Down
Unless otherwise stated in a description, whenever you have to divide a number while playing, round down, regardless of what decimal you have left over.

# Chapter I: Characters
As in all TTRPGs, characters are the building blocks of any game in Natural Progression. The characters, or from a certain point of view, the players who play the characters, drive a campaign forward, and their decisions can not only impact a campaign itself, but the world that the campaign is set in.
:
The following chapter describes character abilities and skills, providing a breakdown of each ability and what it represents, as well as the skills associated with each ability.
:
From here, the steps needed to create a character are provided.

## Character Abilities and Skills
All characters have stats that represent their proficiencies in general - fortitude, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, charisma.
:
Unlike other TTRPG's that have both a modifier and a stat, in Natural Progression, modifiers and stats are one and the same. A character's ability score is the same as their modifier. Likewise, there is no such thing as a proficiency bonus - each skill has it's own modifier and can be increased naturally throughout gameplay.

### Fortitude
Fortitude represents a characters strength, both physical and mental. The Fortitude ability has the following skills:

##### Athletics
Athletics is the main ability that reflects a character's physical prowess. Its general usage is for whenever a character is doing a short term activity or something that would require a great deal of strength, such as jumping a large gap, scaling a tall building or attempting to stop an individual from tackling them.
:
A character with a high Athletics modifier would likely have large muscles, or at the very least, appear fit and toned.

##### Constitution
Constitution is the ability representing a character's ability to resist disease and other physical ailments or injuries. As such, it is the ability that directly affects a character's hitpoints. Constitution may be used to determine if a character is affected by a poison that they ingested, or if an attack leaves them wounded.

##### Endurance
Endurance is the other ability that reflects a character's physical prowess. Unlike Athletics, Endurance is used whenever a character is doing a physical activity for an extended period of time. As such, Endurance directly affects how many attacks a character can evade before exhaustion starts to in. Some examples include travelling at an increased rate or participating in a multi-stage tournament or performing.
:
A character with a high Endurance modifier would likely have a toned body, similar to how an Atheletic character would look, but without the larger muscles.

##### Mental Fortitude
Mental Fortitude is represents exactly what is sounds like - a character's ability to withstand mental stress, trauma and attacks. Mental Fortitude may be used to determine if a player is affected by mind control or the death of a companion.

### Dexterity
Dexterity represents a character's reflexes and ability to perform physical activies that require precision rather than brute force. The Dexterity ability has the following skills:

##### Acrobatics
Acrobatics is the final ability that reflects a character's ability to perform phyisical tasks in general. Acrobatics represents a character's ability to do balance related tasks - should a task require some form of strength to perform, Acrobatics should not be used to determine if they are successful. That task should fall to Athletics or Endurance then.
:
Some examples of activities that a character might perform acrobatically include walking across a tightrope or descending down a steep hill.
:
A character with a high Acrobatics modifier would likely appear toned and fit in general, but not show great strength like one might expect from a character with a high Athletics modifier.

##### Reflex
Reflex represents a character's ability to react to surprising situations, such as an ambush or a villain who was thought to be dead reappearing. Depending on the nature of a combat, Reflex may be used to determine initiative rolls.

{{footnote Chapter I: Characters | Abilities }}

\page

##### Sleight of Hand
Sleight of Hand represents a character's ability to perform small precise movements with their hands. This ability is not only used when a character is attempting to steal something, but also when playing most instruments or when playing a card game.

##### Stealth
Stealth represents a character's ability to get small and low to the ground. Some of examples of when Stealth may be used include when a character is attempting to follow an individual without being noticed or when attempting to make oneself small to follow a culture's customs. Depending on the nature of a combat, Stealth my be used to determine initiative rolls.

### Intelligence
Intelligence represents a character's booksmarts and ability to connect and understand information. Intelligence has the following skills:

##### Arcana
Arcana represents a character's ability to understand magic. Arcana may be used to determine the effects of a magic item or to known what spell a character is casting from their words and actions.

##### History
History represents a character's knowledge of factual events and their memory of their experiences. Some examples include knowning the name and outcome of a conflict between to nations or remembering the name of a merchant with which the character recently interacted.

##### Investigation
Investigation represents a character's ability to search for a particular object and to recognize when an object would not be able to be discovered in the area. Some examples include searching an office for political papers, looking for traps in a dungeon, or recognizing a draft coming from a wall being indicative of a hidden door.

##### Medicine
Medicine represents a character's understanding of the body and practices that can be used to help one heal. Some usages of Medicine include knowing the severity of an injury and knowing how to treat an injury.

##### Nature
Nature represents a character's ability to identify and know the natural properties of plants and animals. Some usages of Nature include knowning what plants are edible, which animals a set of tracks might belong to, or the natural properties of a given creature.

##### Riddle
Riddle represents a character's ability to solve puzzles or figure out hints for a given problem. Some usages include being able to figure out the meaning of an encrypted message given a cipher, or figuring out that the phrase "Speak Friend, and enter" is a riddle.

##### Tradition
Tradition is a unique skill - there technically can any number of types of Tradition skills, depending on the number of cultures, races and religions within a world. Each Tradition skill represents a character's ability to know the customs and lore of any specific culture or race.
:
Some examples would include knowing traditional greetings for a culture and understanding the important stories within a race's lore.

### Wisdom
Wisdom represents a character's streetsmarts and ability to perceive and understand their surroundings. Wisdom has the following skills:

##### Animal Handling
Animal Handling represents a character's ability to interact with beasts and understand their body language. Some usages include knowning when an animal is uncomfortable or being able to train an animal.

##### Insight
Insight represents a character's ability to discern a another character's true intentions and body language. Some usages include being able to tell in someone is withholding part of the truth or knowing if a character is uncomfortable.

##### Perception
Perception represents a character's ability to perceive their surroundings. Perception differs from Investigation by origin - one may notice a draft on a room with a Perception check, but would need an Investigation check to figure out where that draft was coming from.
:
Some examples including keeping a watchful eye during a night's watch or noticing that a jewel is missing from a necklace.
:
Depending on the nature of combat, Perception may be used to determine initiative rolls.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter I: Characters | Abilities }}

\page

##### Survival
Survival represents a character's ability to traverse the wild and live off of the land. Survival differs from nature in terms of detail. With a Survival check on tracks, one may be able to follow the tracks. With a Nature check on the same tracks, one may be able to discern some guesses as to what creature may have left said tracks.
:
Some usages including finding a suitable campsite away from the road or being able to known where a creature may pass.
### Charisma
Charisma represents a character's force of will upon others. The Charisma ability has the following skills:

##### Deception
Deception represents a character's ability to lie. Not only does it represent the way that a character may tell a lie, but it also dictates the actions that the character performs while they lie - during a poor Deception check, a charater may avoid eye contact with their target or be constantly shifting in their seat, being visibly uncomfortable.

##### Intimidation
Intimidation represents a character's ability to threaten another individual into doing what they want. Some examples include blackmailing a corrupt politician to pass a law or to threaten someone's life if they do not yield specific information.

##### Performance
Performance represents a character's ability to perform a task for others. This skill check may be paired with another skill check to see how well said skill is performed.
:
For example, if a character is walking across a tightrope during a circus event, they would have to make both a Performance and Acrobatics check. The Acrobatics check would dictate how well the walked across the tightrope, and the Performance check would define how entertaining their action was.

##### Persuasion
Persuasion represents a character's ability to convince another to do what they want without lying or intimidating. Some usages include getting a powerful noble to support the character on a quest or to haggle with a merchant about the price of an object.

### Saving Throws

Some abilities and spells, rather than mentioning a skill check, call for a skill Saving Throw. A Saving Throw is a specific type of skill check that is used in response to something affecting your character.
:
This does mean that an ability that can only be used on a check for a given skill, say Athletics, can also be used when rolling an Athletics Saving Throw.

## Performing Skill Checks Within a Game

Now that each ability and their corresponding checks have been defined, how do they get used?
:
When a check is needed, a player should roll a d20 and add their ability modifier, skill modifier and other modifiers (this will likely be 0) to the roll. Should this total equal or surpass the Difficulty Class of the check, the player succeeds. 
:
On a roll of a natural 20, the character a figured out a new technique, or improved upon their old technique and their skill modifier increases by 1, up to a limit of 11. Learning does take time, so only one skill modifier can be increased in this manner per rest. For actions that have no roll of your own associated with it, but instead have a Saving Throw, the target rolling a natural 1 can be used to increase your associated modifier.
:
This limit of one increase per day extends to weapons and tools as well. The first natural 20 (assuming the associated modifier is not maxed out already) will increase the skill, tool or weapon modifier, and any other natural 20 rolled that day will not increase the associated modifier.
:
It should be noted that there should be no such thing as an "Ability check" - a player should never roll a Fortitude check. Rather, they should roll a skill check that is most related to the activity, whether it be Athletics, Constitution, Endurance or Mental Fortitude.
:
This does mean that there is no way for a character to increase their base ability modifiers outside of their Background, Class, Culture or Race. This is 100% intentional; ability modifiers are meant to represent a character's natural strengths and weaknesses with their given Background, Class, Culture and Race. 
:
For more information on these four items, please refer to the Character Creation part of this chapter.

{{footnote Chapter I: Characters | Skill Checks }}

\page

### An example
Suppose that a character with a Charisma modifier of 2 and an Intimidation modifier of 5 under no magical effects or injuries would like to attempt to get information out a bandit that they just captured by threatening them.
:
Their Lore Master calls for an Intimidation check, and to the player's delight, they roll a natural 20. Their skill check is 20 + 2 (ability modifier) + 5 (skill modifier) + 0 (other modifiers), for a total of 27. This passes the Difficulty Class of 20 set by the Lore Master, and the bandit yields the information that they have.
:
Since the character rolled a natural 20, their intimidation modifier increased by 1 to 6, so all future Intimidation checks would be their roll + 2 (ability modifier) + 6 (skill modifier) + other modifiers.

### Training

Sometimes, the dice give many natural 20s, and on other days, they give more natural 1s. In order to help combat a player's luck from impacting a character's progression, characters can train at a skill in order to improve their modifiers.
:
Characters must receive their training from an individual with a higher modifier than their own for the specified skill. The trainer can be another party member, or an NPC that the party (potentially) hires.
:
A character can train for up to 8 hours a day. While training they cannot focus on any other tasks. For every week between training sessions, a character will lose 8 hours of training, decreasing to a minimum of 0 hours.
:
Once a character hits 100 hours trained, their skill modifier increases by 1, and their hour count resets to 0 hours. If a character's training for a day goes over 100 hours, the remainder wraps around to the next level, assuming the trainer still has a higher modifier than you after you increase yours.
:
A character can work on multiple skills at a time. Should a character roll a natural 20 on a skill check while they have hours trained and have not increased a skill modifier since their last rest, their skill modifier will increase like normal and their hours of training will reset to 0 hours.
:
Training can also be applied to weapon and tool modifiers as well, with the same restrictions listed in this section.

{{note
#### Variants
##### A. Modifier Maximum
For players that enjoy having larger (or smaller) modifiers, the skill modifier limit can be modified. A suggested increased modifier maximum is 21.

##### B. Modifier Maximum Calculation
When determining if a skill modifier has reached the chosen limit, rather than just looking at the skill modifier, add the ability modifier and the skill modifier together. If this total is equal to the chosen limit, then the ability modifier has hit its maximum.
:
If using the Variable Ability Modifier Variant (below), do not use this variant.

##### C. No Ability Modifiers
Given that ability modifiers are representing a character's natural strengths and weaknesses, a group may choose to forgo ability modifiers, and have characters combine their ability modifier into each skill modifier.
:
For example, a character's Fortitude modifier would be added to their existing Athletics, Constitution, Endurance and Mental Fortitude modifiers to get their current skill modifier. This would change their skill check calculation to:
:
d20 + skill modifier + other modifiers
:
If using the Variable Ability Modifier Variant (below), do not use this variant.

##### D. Variable Ability Modifier
When determining the ability modifier, the used ability does not have to be the pre-defined one as dictated in this section.
:
For the above example, should the player attempt to intimidate the bandit by listing off all of the different ways to kill him using just the objects within reach, the character's Intelligence modifier could be used in place of their Charisma modifier.
:
If using the Modifier Maximum Calculation Variant (above), do not use this variant.
}}

## Passive Skill Checks
Passive skill checks can be used for a check to determine what a character notices or portrays when they are not actively doing something that would require a check. Passive skill checks are calculated as follows:
:
1 + primary ability modifier + skill modifier + other modifiers
:
Passive Perception would be calculated as:
:
1 + Wisdom ability modifier + Peception skill modifier + other modifiers

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter I: Characters | Passive Skill Checks }}

\page

A good way to separate the idea of passive checks compared to active checks is that a passive check is a character's baseline knowledge of something. It is the equivalent of rolling a natural 1 on the skill check.

### An example
Suppose that a character has a magical item with unknown effects. A character with a high passive Perception would notice that there are markings on this item, while a character with a high passive Arcana would know that these markings are magical runes.
:
However, in order to find out what these runes do, a character would have to succeed on an Arcana check or find someone who would know what the runes are, which may require a Persuasion or Tradition check.

## Character Creation

Now that character abilities and skills, as well as their usages, have been defined, what is needed to create a character?
:
Each character is created from four main categories: their Background, Culture, Class and Race.
:
First think about what race you want your character to be. Do you want them to be an immortal and fair Elf? Or are they a more down to earth Dwarf?
:
Next, think about what your character did prior to their time adventuring to choose a Background. Were they a woodcarving artisan, or were they a miner?
:
Third, consider why your character began adventuring, or what skills you would like your character to focus on. This will help you decide upon a Class. Are they hunting a bandit who stole something, or perhaps they are searching for the most beautiful jewel?
:
Finally, ponder on the values, strengths and weaknesses of the people your character is from to determine your character's Culture. You will likely be working with your Lore Master to determine a Culture that is representative of your character's people. Are your people fair and wise, placing to good of the all people over their own, but prone to missing the plight of mortals? Are they good-hearted and strong, with no stronger bond than their family, but more stubborn than anything in the world?
:
Once you have decided upon one Background, Culture, Class and Race, work with your Lore Master to add any modifications that they may have. Once this has been finished, enjoy your campaign!

# Chapter II: Races
A character's Race should represent their physical characteristics, and should be something that any character, NPC or PC, could figure out by a quick glance at yours. Your character's race should not quantify what your character values, where they are from, or any of their personal preferences - those should be shaped by their Culture, Background and Backstory. 
:
Mechanically, any Race is possible - the most important things are that it fits into the setting and that your Lore Master is ok with your Race. This chapter will both provide the general rules to follow when Homebrewing your own Races and provide some official Races.
:
## General Rules for Races
Directly after the name of the Race, there will be a short description giving a basic overview of their racial traits. There also may be some references to a stereotypical Culture for the race, but that can be ignored if your player's Culture does not follow those stereotypes.

### Names
Following the general description of the race will follow the general rules and some example names for individuals of the Race. These are not hard rules, and can be ignored if you wish.

### Race Traits
Every races has 4 "bonuses" between their ability modifier increases and their unique traits. For instance, the Dwarven race on the next page has a +2 to their Fortitude ability modifier (counts as 2 bonuses), a +1 to their Charisma modifier (counts as 1 bonus), as well as the Dwarven Toughness trait (counts as 1 bonus).
:
Many of these traits may vary by Culture - if they do, refer to the entry in your character's Culture rather than those in the Race.
:
**Ability Modifier Increases**

This section will list what abilities get increased by the Race, and by how much. The total sum of the Ability modifier increase will not exceed 4.
:
**Age**

Ths section will list both the general age at which individuals of the Race reach adulthood and their typical lifespan. The age at which an individual comes of age may vary by adulthood, but the typical lifespan rarely does.
:
**Languages**

This section will list what languages an individual of this Race can speak and write.
:
**Senses**

A Race's senses are compared to what humans generally experience.
:
**Size**

Each race has an average size - both in height and weight. This dictates what size rating they have. Most races will be Medium. There can be variation in the average height and weight, but not size rating.
:
**Speed**

This will define the base speed at which a Race can walk in combat. This trait will not vary by Culture.
:
**Racial Combat Training**

This section will give starting modifiers for specific types of weapons. Generally the bonuses will be a +1 bonus to 3 types of weapons.
:
**Racial Magic Bonuses**

This section will give modifiers to specific types of magic, or allow characters to start with certain spells learned. This bonus will be at most +1 to one type of magic.
:
**Racial Tool Bonuses**

This section will give modifiers to specific tools, and may give starting tools to characters. Generally the bonuses will be a +1 bonus to 4 tools
:
**Additional Traits**

If the total of the Race's Ability Modifier increases does not equal 4, there will be one trait for each "missed" Ability modifier increase - for instance, if a Race only has a sum of +2 to their Ability modifiers, there will be 2 abilities at the end of the racial traits section.

## Dwarf
The "Hardy Folk" of most Realms, Dwarves are some of the most enduring races in existant. Additionally, they tend to be quite stoic and stubborn, which many attribute to their hardiness.
:
Despite being quite vigorous, Dwarves tend to be on the shorter size, with most Races standing upwards of a foot taller on average. Their skin tones vary depending on where they live, but generally a pale white for those living in the deepest recesses of the earth, to a dark deep brown. Likewise, their hair color varies anywhere from a light tan to black. Notably, it is harder to distinguish Dwarven men from women - both are able to grow beards.
:
Dwarves tend to fulfill the labor portion of many societies - their natural skills allow them to mine and smith more efficiently that other Races. In combat, Dwarves like their gear to reflect their bodies. They prefer heavier armors, and weapons reflective of their work.

### Names
Dwarves tend to have both a first name and a family or clan name, but generally only go by their first name. They prefer simpler names, usually no more than 2 syllables.

## Elf
In many realms, the Elves are the immortal, fair and wise people. They are long lived, and in their lifetimes, tend to learn wisdom that other races are unable to learn.
:
Elves tend to be quite slim and tall, towering above most races, especially Dwarves and Halflings. Due to this combination of being tall and slim, they are surprisingly nimble for their height. Their hair and skin color vary as much as humans, and entirely depends on their ancestry and where they live.
:
Within societies, Elves tend to fulfill clerical and administrative tasks, but it is not unheard of for them to be part of militaries and guards. In fact, many Elves make great scouts due to their innate abilities to blend into it.

### Names

Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.

On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.
:
**Child Names**: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall
:

:
**Senses**

Compared to Humans, Elves have better eyes. You have Darkvision, and can see in dim light within 60 ft of you as if it were bright light.

:
**One with Nature**

Elves feel a unique bond with nature - almost as if the plants and animals speak with them. This gives Elves a sixth sense that allows them to more easily track their quarry and hunt for food.

These voices are almost always with Elves, whispering in the back of their mind. While in the Wild, you gain advantage on any **Nature** or **Survival** check.

## Halfling
Known as the "Little Folk", Halflings are Dwarfed by every other humanoid race, including Dwarves. Generally standing no more than 4 feet tall, they are commonly mistaken as human children.
:
Halflings generally like to be left to their own devices, farming or spending their days with their friends and family. However, when they do leave home for an adventure, their small size helps them to be very stealthy.
:
In fact, it is remarked by some that it is good luck whenever a Halfling is going on an adventure. For some reason, their groups tend to succeed, even when the situation seems dire.

## Half-Races
The Races listed above may not cover the character that you wish to play. What if you want to play a Half-Elf (Elf and Human), or a Dwarfling (Dwarf and Halfling)? Rather than creating your own Race, you can use the following rules for getting Race stats of mixed character.
:
Note that these rules are meant for Races that are half one Race and half of a second. If you want to create a character having more than 2 Races in their descent (such as  a child of a Half-Elf and Dwarfling pairing), choose two of the original Races and use those when creating your Race. Likewise, only Races of one size larger or smaller can be created - a pairing of a Medium and a Small race is allowed, but not one of a Tiny and Medium.

:
**Ability Modifier Increases**

From each parent, a Half-Race inherits both a Primary Ability Modifier Increase and a unique trait. If you choose not to inherit unique trait (or the parent Race does not have any), your Half-Race also gets the Secondary Ability Modifier Increase of that parent Race.

| Race 		 | Primary Ability Modifier Increase 									   | Secondary Ability Modifier Increase 										 |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
| Dwarf    | Your **Fortitude** ability modifier increases by 1    | Your **Charisma** ability modifier increases by 1   |
| Elf      | Your **Dexterity** ability modifier increases by 1    | Your **Wisdom** ability modifier increases by 1   |
| Halfling | Your **Dexterity** ability modifier increases by 1    | You can increase the ability modifier of one ability by 1 |
| Human    | Your **Intelligence** ability modifier increases by 1 | You can increase the ability modifier of one ability by 1 |
:
**Age**

Pick one of the adulthood ages of your parent Races and use that as your Race's age of adulthood. For your Race's expected lifetime, either pick one of your parent Races' expective lifetime, or average it out. If one parent Race is Elves, only choose between your parent Races' expected lifetime.
:
**Languages**

Your character should speak all languages that their parent Races speak.
:
**Senses**

Any special senses that your parent Races share should be present. For instance, if your character is the offspring of a Dwarf and an Elf, your Dwelf Race should have Darkvision for up to 60 feet.

If you character's parent Races have different senses, confer with your Lore Master to determine which of the conflicting senses should be used.
:
**Size**

Just like age, pick either the one of your parent Races' heights and weights, or average it out. When determining your size, if both of your parent Races have the same size, use that size. Otherwise, confer with your Lore Master to determine which size should be used.
:
**Speed**

If your parent Races' base walking speed matches, use that speed. Otherwise, confer with your Lore Master to determine what base walking speed should be used. It is likely that your Race's speed will match your Race's size.
:
**Half-Race Combat Training**

You get half of the combat training bonuses from the combined total of each race. You can choose any combination of the bonuses up to half of the total, meaning that you can only take bonuses from one parent race.
:
**Half-Race Magic Bonuses**

You get half of the magic bonuses from the combined total of each race. You can choose any combination of the bonuses up to half of the total, meaning that you can only take bonuses from one parent race.
:
**Half-Race Tool Bonuses**

You get half of the tool bonuses from the combined total of each race. You can choose any combination of the bonuses up to half of the total, meaning that you can only take bonuses from one parent race.
:
**Special Traits**

A Half-Race can receive up to one unique trait from each parent. If a parent Race does not have one unique trait, or you do not want to take one of their traits, you can instead take the Race's Secondary Ability Modifier Increase.

Refer to the below table listing the possible unique traits that each parent Race has.

| Race     | Traits                               |
|:---------|:-------------------------------------|
| Dwarf    | Dwarven Toughness                    |
| Elf      | One with Nature							        |
| Halfling | Uncanny Luck, Halfling Stealth       |
| Human    | Humans do not have any unique traits |

### Grór the Dwarfling (Example Half-Race)

With the exception of his height, Grór appears to look like a Dwarf. Standing at 3'10", Grór is rather short for a Dwarf. His height can be owed to his father, who was actually a Halfling.
:
**Ability Modifier Increases**

A Dwarfling inherits the Primary Ability Modifier Increase from both parent Races. As Dwarflings inherit a unique trait from each parent, no Secondary Ability Modifier Increases are used.

Your **Fortitude** ability modifier increases by 1

Your **Dexterity** ability modifier increases by 1
:
**Age**

Both Dwarfs and Halfling reach adulthood at age 18. Since Grór was raised by his mother, he is not considered an adult until age 30 however.

As Dwarfs tend to reach 250 years old and Halflings tend to reach 120 years old, the lifespan of a Dwarfling is in the middle of that, at about 180 years.
:
**Languages**

As Dwarves speak both Command and Dwarvish, and Halflings only speak Common, you can speak and write Common and Dwarvish.
:
**Senses**

After conferring with the Lore Master, Dwarven Darkvision was carried down into Dwarflings, but the range has weakened. Dwarfling senses are rather standard with the exception of their eyesight. You have Darkvision, and can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light.
:
**Size**

After conferring with the Lore Master, since Grór is supposed to mostly be built like a Dwarf, your size is Medium.
:
**Speed**

As both Dwarves and Halflings have the same walking speed, your base walking speed is 25 ft.
:
**Dwarfling Combat Training**

Being raised by his mother, Grór was trained in standard Dwarven Combat techniques. You gain a +1 bonus to all **Axes**, **Crossbows** and **Hammers and Picks**
:
**Dwarfling Magic Bonuses**

You gain a +1 bonus to **Transmutation Magic**
:
**Dwarfling Tool Bonuses**

Trained by his mother, Grór gains a +1 bonus to 4 of the following tools: **Brewer's Supplies**, **Carpenter's Tools**, **Climber's Kit**, **Cobbler's Tools**, **Glassblower's Tools**, **Jeweler's Tools**, **Leatherworker's Tools**, **Mason's Tools**, **Smith's Tools**, and **Tinker's Tools**.
:
**Dwarfling Toughness**

As Grór look like a Dwarf, he inherited his Mother's Dwarven Toughness, which gives him increases Fortitude when dealing with poison or mind control. You gain resistance to poison damage and checks against poison or mind control.
:
**Uncanny Luck**

One of the few things Grór inherited from his father was his uncanny ability to get lucky in intense situations. Once per rest, when you roll a 1 on a d20 roll, you can reroll the die and use the new roll.

# Chapter III: Cultures

Unlike a character's Race, which represents their physical characteristics and abilities related to that, a character's Culture should represent their values and skills.
:
Depending on the setting, a Culture can be grouped by any number of things such as Race, hometown, region or kingdom.
:
This differs from Background as a Culture should represent the values and experiences all members of a culture should have. A Culture should not represent how a Character adds to society, or in other words, what jobs they did in the past - that is what a Background is for.
:
As with Races, any Culture is possible, with the same restrictions: it should fit the setting and be approved by your Lore Master. This chapter will provide both the general rules for creating Cultures, and some examples as well.

## General Rules for Cultures

Below are the differing sections that *may* appear on a Culture description. The only required trait is **Skill Modifier Increases** - for any fields that are not present, refer to your Race's rules for that section.

### Names

Cultures generally have names, or at the very least, naming conventions, that are followed. They may be as simple as following your Race's names, or they could have their own rules.

### Culture Traits

Every culture has some skills in which they pride themselves. Mechanically, similar as with Races and their **Ability Modifier Increases**, there are 6 "bonuses" between skill modifier increases and additional traits. More than likely, all 6 bonuses will be skill modifier increases, but Cultures can have additional traits.
:
**Skill Modifier Increases**

This section will list what skills get increased by this Culture. The total sum of the Skill Modifier increases will not exceed 6.
:
**Age**

Individuals of differing cultures can have different expected lifespans or adulthood ages.
:
**Languages**

As with **Age**, the languages used for a Culture may differ from that of the character's Race.
:
**Senses**

A Culture's senses may differ from that of Races. For example, a Culture that predominantly resides underground would likely have developed or improved Darkvision of some kind, regardless of Race, as well as some sort of sunlight sensitivity.
:
**Speed**

As with **Senses**, individuals from a Culture may have developed a different speed from their Race. For example, a migratory Culture may have developed a speed 5 ft faster than that of their Race's.
:
**Culture Combat Training**

Like Race's, each Culture tends to have preferences over which weapons they use. If this section exists, it overrides the bonuses given by a character's race. This section generally has a +1 bonus to 3 weapon types.
:
**Culture Magic Bonuses**

Magic is not necessarily innate. Some Cultures have magic that all members learn, which will be listed in this section. If this section exists, it overrides the bonuses given by a character's race.
:
**Culture Tool Bonuses**

Some Cultures have specific tools that they prefer. If this section exists, it overrides the bonuses given by a character's race. This section generally has a +1 bonus to 4 tool types.
:
**Additional Traits**

Should there be any **Skill Modifier Increases** bonuses that are not used on Skill Modifiers, they will instead show up as additional traits at the bottom of the Culture.

## The Dwarves of Dwarfhold (Example Culture)

Appearing as a simple cave opening, only those who know of the secret door know of the beauty within. Behind the outer ways lies the kingdom of the Dwarves of Dwarfhold. Within this sacred kingdom lies carefully carved halls, lit with the fires of the Ancients, always with the sound of distant clanging.
:
This realm is the premier mining realm of the land, and the home of all Dwarves. There may be other Races who reside within these walls. However, it is rare to find a non-Dwarf living in Dwarfhold.

# Chapter IV: Backgrounds

Unlike a character's Culture, a Background is representative of how a character adds to society, or previous jobs that they had. A Background should not describe a character's physical characteristics or personality unless it is explicitely part of the Background.
:
For example, a character with the Miner background may tend to have darkened skin due to the amount of time underground and the amount of dirt and dust they are exposed to while working.

## General Rules for Backgrounds

Below are the different sections that will appear in a Background description.

### Background Traits

:
**Tool Modifier Increases**

:
**Additional Trait**

# Chapter V: Archetypes and Classes

A character's class is most likely the part that most greatly impacts a build. Unlike other TTRPGs, Natural Progressions doesn't have the concept of subclasses. Instead, each class is split into it's implementations of two archetypes, might and magic.
:
Despite seemingly being opposites of each other, the two archetypes for each class are brought together by the overarching theme of each class. For example, the Novitiate class is built around the concept of an individual who studies and trains within existing institutions, and the class features of the Fighter and Wizard are built around the same idea.
:
The beauty of having each class implement both archetypes is that no multiclassing is necessary to have a character that has abilities from the might and magic archetypes. As a character levels up, they can choose which archetype of their class they want to take a level in. The only limitation to this switching is that the archetype you chose at Level 1 is greater than or equal to the level of the opposite.
:
For example, when a level 1 Novitiate with 1 level in Fighter, levels up to Level 2, they can choose (assuming no multiclassing) to take the second level Fighter feature, or the first level Wizard feature. Assuming they took the first level Wizard feature, when they level up to level 3 (with the same assumption of no multiclassing), they would have to take the second level Fighter feature.
:
## Class Overview

Each class will start off with a description of the overarching idea behind it. Following this description will come the two archetypes, first the might implementation, then the magic.

### Implementation Name (Archetype Type)

**Skill Modifier Bonuses**: The skills that have their modifier increases will be detailed here. Generally, there will be options, such as "choose 3 of the following skills". There is no overlap when a character takes levels in both archetypes.
:
**Weapon Modifier Bonuses**: The weapons groups that a character has an increased weapon modifier for. There is no overlap when a character takes levels in both archetypes. 
:
**Armor Training**: The armor types that the archetype can use. The training for light and medium armor overlaps - if the might or magic archetype is trained in light or medium armor and you have a level in each archetype, you are trained in it. For heavy armor, your initial archetype must be trained in it.
:
**Shield Training**: Whether you can use shields. This training overlaps - if either archetype has training and you have a level in both, you are trained in Shields.
:
**Starting Equipment**: Rather self explanatory. There obviously is no overlap when a character takes levels in both archetypes.
:
**Health**: This section will detail how much health your character has at level 1, and how much they gain with each level taken in an archetype.
:
Following these bonuses, there will be a table depicting what features are gained at each level, like the following:

| Level | Feature Gained |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Level 1 Feature |
| 2 | Level 2 Feature |
| 3 | etc... |
:
Finally, each feature will be defined as such:

#### Class Feature

Here a description of the feature and what is does. If there are options on the feature (such as Fighting Style in all might archetype implementations), they will be displayed as follows:

##### Option 1

Description of the option

##### Option 2

## Artisan

All items need to have a creator. Artisans create, improve and repair objects, and have learned a number of skills to help them with this process.

### Craftsmen (Martial)

**Skill Modifier Bonuses**: You gain a +1 increase to 3 of the following skills: **Athletics**, **Constitution**, **Endurance**, **Reflex**, **Investigation**, **Insight**, **Perception**, **Deception**, **Intimidation**, **Performance**.
:
**Tool Modifier Bonuses**: You gain a +3 modifier to one of the tool kits. You gain a +2 modifier to two other tool kits, and a +1 modifier to 3 others. You cannot choose the same tool kit to gain multiple modifiers from Craftsmen.
:
**Weapon Modifier Bonuses**: You gain a +2 modifier increase to **Hammers and Picks**, as well as another +2 modifier to another weapon group.
:
**Armor Training**: You are trained with Light, Medium and Heavy armor.
:
**Shield Training**: You are trained with Shields.
:
**Starting Equipment**: 5d4 * 10 gold to spend on your starting equipment
:
**Health**: At the first level, you start with 11 + your Constitution Modifier + your Reflex Modifier hit points, and gain the same amount upon a level up.

| Level | Feature Gained |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Crafting |
| 2 | Battle Smith |
| 3 | Fighting Style |
| 4 | Artisan of All Trades |
| 5 | Extra Attack |
| 6 | Improved Crafting |
| 7 | Flash of Genius |
| 8 | Improved Artisan of All Trades |
| 9 | Tool Expertise |
| 10 | Improved Battle Smith |
| 11 | Masterwork |

#### Crafting

Starting at the 1st level, assuming you have access to the required tools and access to any needed environments, such as a forge, you are able to craft 5 gp * your Craftsmen level worth of a mundane object (that is not a +1 weapon or +1 armor) per day. If you finish crafting an object on a day but have spare gp left of your daily allotance, you can begin construction on another mundane item.
:
You do not need to specifically have the raw materials on hand. If you don't have already, you just need the gold and a means to buy said materials.

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it has been used or dispelled.

Your religion holds that when you follow something, you should not waver in your beliefs. You gain advantage to Mental Fortitude checks and Saving Throws.

##### Joy

Your religion believes that a person's greatest happiness comes from their faith. You become immune to falling into despair or becoming Frightened. Allied creatures within 30 ft of you gain advantage to Saving Throws against becoming Frightened. Once per rest, you remember this joy, regaining hit points equal to twice your Paladin level.
:
If this total takes you over your maximum hit points, any extra hit points become temporary hit points. Any temporary hit points gained from this ability that are not lost during combat will be lost upon taking a rest.

##### Self Sacrifice

Your religion holds that a love of others is the most important attribute of someone. Once per round, when an allied creature is targetted from an attack, you can interpose yourself between the attacker and your ally. The attack roll is then made against your Armor Class, and if the attack hits, you take the damage. You must interpose before the LM states the attack roll.

{{footnote Chapter V: Classes | War Priest }}

\page

Additionally, you must have the movement range (subtracting movement already expended in this round of combat) to reach the point where you would interpose yourself. This ability does not count as a Reaction.
##### Suffering

Your religion holds that people only grow from suffering. Even if the suffering is moments before death, your religious tenants state that a person can take the knowledged gained from the experience into their afterlife. As a follower of your religion, it is your duty to inflict that suffering. Your crit range increases by 1 - if you have no other modifiers to you crit range, it would be 19-20. 

#### Relentless Avenger

At the ninth level, you feel anger and pain when your allies are attacked. As a reaction when an ally is attacked, you can immediately make an opportunity attack against this foe. You do not need to be adjacent to this enemy already, but they need to be within your movement range (subtracting movement already expended in this round of combat). The speed and ferocity of any movement you take as part of this reaction is too fast for opponents to make opportunity attacks.

#### Second Aura of Leadership

## Multiclassing

As hinted in the chapter overview, having a character multiclass is possible. However, there are a few restrictions.
:
In order to multiclass into another class's archetype that matches your primary one, you must have more levels in your primary class than what you are multiclassing into. If you are a level 1 Novitiate with one level in Fighter, you can multiclass into any other class' martial archetype, such as Artisan's Craftsmen. When leveling up to level 3, assuming you took the level 1 Craftsmen feature as your level 2 bonus, you can multiclass into another class' martial archetype that is not Artisan, or you can take the second level Fighter feature.
:
You cannot take the level two Craftsmen feature, because then your number of levels in Craftsmen would outweight your number of levels in Fighter.
:
It is not considered multiclassing to take levels in your class's opposite archetype - a level 1 Novitiate with one level in Fighter can take their level 2 increase in Wizard. However, with subsequent level ups, you must take a second level in Fighter prior to levelling up Wizard. Your number of levels in your primary archetype must be equal to or greater than the number of levels in the other.
:
Finally, when multiclassing into another class' opposite archetype, your primary class' opposite archetype must be at an equal or higher level than the second class'. For instance, say that a character started off as a level 1 Novitiate (Fighter). They could not multiclass into Artisan (Artificier) until level 4.
:
Novitiate (Fighter) 1 + Artisan (Artificier) 1 doesn't work as the character's Novitiate (Wizard) level is not equal to or greater than Artisan (Artificier) 1.
:
Novitiate (Fighter) 1 + Novitiate (Wizard) 1 + Artisan (Artificier) 1 doesn't work as the character's Magic archetype's level is greater than the character's Martial archetype (which is their primary).
:
This character would need to be Novitiate (Fighter) 2 + Novitiate (Wizard) 1 in order to take a level in Artisan (Artificier).

### Features Gained

When you first multiclass into another class or take the first level in your classes' opposite Archetype , you do not gain any of the modifiers shown under **Skill Modifier Bonuses**, **Tool Modifier Bonuses**, **Weapon Modifier Bonuses**, or **Starting Equipment**. For **Armor Training**, you only gain training with Light Armor, if the class you are multiclassing into has it, and Shields.
:
For **Mana** and **Number of Spells Known**, if this is the first level in your classes' opposite archetype, you gain the first level increases. Otherwise, you take the level up bonuses.

# Chapter VI: Equipment
For some players, the most exciting thing about character creation is considering how they act in combat; what armor will they be wearing? What weapon(s) will they have? Will they be a knight, wielding a sword and board, or will they be a classic barbarian, running around with no armor and a great axe?
:
In Natural Progressions, weapons and tools function just like skills - the modifier used is increased on a roll of a natural 20 and they have a maximum of 11, assuming no variant rules are used.
:
Weapons are grouped by categories. For example, when rolling a natural 20 when wielding a dagger, your **Dueling Blades** modifier increases by 1.
:
Rather than having a distinct armor or shield modifier like with weapons, both armor and shields add to a character's armor class, which is calculated as follows:
:
10 + armor bonus + weapon bonus + shield bonus + reflex skill modifier

## Weapons
This section details the weapons that are available to be used in Natural Progressions. First weapon properties will be defined, followed by the weapons themselves.
:
To give the feeling of progressing as a character gets better with a weapon, the traits and damage of weapons change depending on your weapon modifier - this is unique to each weapon (although bonuses may be given to a group of weapons, such as all Ambush Weapons).
:
The ability level is as follows:

0-1: **Untrained**

2-4: **Trained** 

5-8: **Experienced**

9-10: **Expert**

11: **Master** (with additionally perk)
:
Experienced, Expert and Master all have level requirements in order to use. A character's modifier can increase up to 11 without hitting the requirements, but their ability level will remain at Trained unless they hit the requirements.
:
**Experienced**: 2 levels in any Martial archetype. These levels can be split in any way among the Martial archetypes.
:
**Expert**: 6 levels in any Martial archetype. 2 of these levels must be within the same archetype.
:
**Master**: 11 levels in any Martial archetype. 5 of these levels must be within the same archetype.
:
Additionally, some abilities granted by weapons have a weapon DC, which is 10 + your weapon ability modifier.

### Improvised Weapons

Theoretically, just about anything can be considered a weapon with enough force - a rock, a bottle, even a pin. However, they generally are not nearly as effective as actual weapons.
:
With no abilities and features that affect improvised weapons, you use your Athletics modifier when determining if the attack hits. Upon a successful attack, you deal 1 damage of a type that makes sense. Generally it will be bludgeoning damage.

### Weapon Properties
Each combination of weapon and ability level has a set of properties that define what a weapon can and cannot do.

#### Affixed
This equipment is worn and wielded in the main or off hand. While dual wielding with an affixed weapon, the other weapon does not need the Light property. Affixed weapons are donned or doffed as an action and cannot be disarmed. While worn, it can be equipped for free during your turn, and while not equipped, it remains attached to your body, leaving your hand open for other things.

{{note
##### Reduced Weapon List
The number of weapons can make choosing a starting weapon(s) daunting. For games where players wish to have a reduced number of weapons to choose from, the following alternate choices are suggested:

**Ambush Weapons**: Guantlet, Unarmed Strike

**Axes**: Great Axe, Hand Axe

**Bludgeons**: Heavy Club, Morningstar, Quarterstaff

**Bows and Slings**: Longbow, Shortbow, Sling

**Combat Blades**: Broadsword, Longsword

**Crossbows**: Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, Light Crossbow

**Dueling Blades**: Dagger, Shortsword

**Flails and Whips**: Light Flail, Heavy Flail

**Hammers and Picks**: Light Hammer, Light Pick, War Hammer

**Polearms**: Bladed Staff, Glaive

**Spears**: Javelin, Pike, War Spear

**Throwing Weapons**: Dart, Throwing Knife

**Natural Weapons**: All

{{footnote Chapter VI: Equipment | Overview }}

\page

#### Awkward
You do not have adequate training or experience to weird this weapon effectively, but you can still use it. You do not add your weapon skill bonus while rolling an attack or damage with this weapon.

#### Barbed
When this weapon is entangling your enemy, and the enemy succeeds on the check to escape from your grapple, that enemy takes your weapon's damage.

#### Balanced
When this weapon rolls a 1 on any of its damage dice, you may reroll that dice but must use the new result. If you wield this weapon with two hands, you may reroll the damage dice if it is a 1 or a 2.

#### Brace
As an action you choose to Brace. On your turn, choose any targets you can see that are more than 20 feet away from you. If any of those targets move within your weapon’s reach before your next turn, as a reaction you can roll one melee attack against them with advantage. If the attack hits, treat the attack as a critical hit. While bracing, if you use a different reaction, or move or get moved, you are no longer bracing. A brace attack is not an opportunity attack.

#### Conceal
At the start of combat, if your passive Sleight of Hand is higher than your enemy's passive perception, or as a bonus action make a Sleight of Hand check to beat this score, you can hide these weapons from your enemy. If hidden, the first attack made with it against a single unaware enemy is treated as attacking a Stunned creature, as your enemy wasn't expecting your weapon. Once you use the weapon, you cannot hide it again, nor can you make any further surprise attacks with any conceal weapon during that same encounter.

#### Deflect
When struck by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect some damage you would receive. If wielding one Deflect weapon, you may roll your weapon's standard damage dice (as defined by the weapon definition in this chapter), then subtract that total from the damage you would receive from a source you can see. If you are wielding a Deflect weapon with two hands, you can roll your weapon's damage dice twice. If you are wielding two deflect weapons, you can roll both weapon's deflect rolls and choose the highest result or you can choose to deflect another attack using your off hand weapon, as part of the same reaction. For the off hand deflect, you only deflect half of the damage on the dice roll.

Deflect does not interact with any other weapon property, such as keen or puncture; you simply roll your weapon's damage dice normally.

#### Disarm
When you hit with a Disarm attack, you deal damage equal to your weapon damage modifier, and force your enemy to roll its choice of an Athletics or Reflex Saving Throw. On a failure, it drops one held object of your choice, landing within 5ft of it in a direction of your choosing. If you have a free hand, you may come into possession of the disarmed object.

If your target is a category size larger than you or using a two-handed weapon, it gains advantage on this save, while enemies two size categories larger than you are immune to this attack from you. If it is smaller than you, it suffers disadvantage. If you land a critical hit with this attack, your weapon deals normal, non-critical damage in addition to forcing your enemy to roll the saving throw.

#### Double Ended
When you take the attack action, you can make one additional attack as an ability action using the damage listed - note that you do not add your weapon ability modifier for the offhand attack - if you are within 5 ft of your target and wielding your weapon with two hands.

#### Entangle
When you hit with an Entangle attack, you deal only your weapon ability modifier, and force the enemy to succeed on its choice of an Athletics or Reflex Saving Throw or be Restrained by you. To escape, the creature must succeed a grapple check against your weapon DC, gaining advantage if it is a size category larger than you. If you land a critical hit, your weapon deals normal, non-critical damage in addition to forcing your enemy to roll the saving throw. Creatures two size categories larger than you are immune to Entangle attacks from you.
:
While you are holding the weapon entangling your target, your weapon attacks against it automatically hit, but only deal damage equal to your weapon ability modifier. You can release an entangled enemy at any time. If you drop the weapon, the creature is immediately free.

#### Heavy
Category size Small creatures suffer disadvantage to attack rolls and Tiny and smaller cannot wield this weapon.

#### Hipshot
This ranged weapon is extremely nimble and maneuverable. When you make a ranged weapon attack, you ignore the disadvantage from a hostile creature within 5ft of you.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter VI: Equipment | Overview }}

\page

#### Keen
This weapon is extraordinarily sharp or devastatingly accurate. When you score a critical hit with this weapon, add an additional damage dice to the weapon damage dice rolled. The added damage dice is not doubled from a critical hit.

#### Knockback
When you hit with a knockback attack, you deal only your weapon ability modifier, and your enemy must succeed on its choice of an Athletics or Reflex Saving Throw or be pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choosing. If you land a critical hit, your weapon deals normal, non-critical damage in addition to forcing your enemy to roll the saving throw. Creatures a size category larger than you gain advantage on this save. Creatures two sizes larger than you are immune to being pushed this way.

#### Light
In order to dual wield two weapons, both weapons you wield must have this property. You can make an attack with your off-hand weapon as a bonus action, but don't add any ability modifier to damage. There is no requirement that your off hand weapon be melee in order to dual wield.

#### Lunge
If you use an attack action, you can use 5ft of movement to attack a foe up to 5ft further than normal. Each attack which uses this property costs 5ft of movement. In order to use the lunge property, there must be clear ground in the direction of your lunge. You cannot lunge if an enemy or obstacle is directly in front of you.

#### Melee
Melee weapons make a melee weapon attack at a target up to 5ft away.

#### Natural
A natural weapon is one which is part of a creature's anatomy, such as teeth and claws. To have a natural weapon, you must either become a creature for which a natural weapon is listed in its stat block, or have a racial ability which allows you to make an attack using claws, teeth, etc in place of an unarmed attack. Natural weapons cannot be removed, disarmed, or broken in any way and are always equipped.

#### Nimble
When you make an attack against a creature that you are restraining or that you are restrained by, or while prone, you gain advantage
to the roll. This advantage does not cancel the disadvantage that may be appled by restraining or being restrained. It replaces it.

#### One Handed
This weapon requires only one hand to wield properly.

#### Penetrate
When you attack an enemy wearing armor, you ignore half of their armor bonus to their Armor Class.

#### Puncture
These piercing weapons deal significantly more damage if they hit a vital weak spot in the enemy. When you roll a maximum value with any of your weapon's damage dice, you can roll that dice again and add the result to the total damage dealt. This can keep happening as many times as you roll maximum values on damage dice, even on the new rolls.

#### Ranged
Ranged weapons make a ranged weapon attack within range. It must be loaded with ammunition to make an attack. The ranged numbers list its normal and maximum range. When attacking enemies beyond the normal range or with an enemy within 5ft of you, you suffer disadvantage for that attack. A ranged weapon cannot attack targets beyond its maximum range.

#### Reach
This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you make a melee weapon attack, as well as for determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. Note that if there is a creature between you and your enemy within reach, your enemy has cover. Reach cannot be used to extend the range of a Double Ended attack.

#### Reload
Some ranged weapons take a time to reload, expressed in types of game actions. These game actions represent the time it takes to reset a weapon and prime it for another attack. From fastest to slowest, these are; free, reaction, ability, attack, action.
:
Reload weapons require two hands to reload unless otherwise stated. If dual wielding with a Reload weapon, one item must be sheathed or dropped to Reload.
:
Reloading as an action means that you must use your action in order to reload your weapon
:
Reloading as attack means you use an attack action and one of your main hand attacks is used to reload. If you have 3 attacks, you attack once, use your second attack to reload, then attack again. Note that you must use either an attack or an action to reload, and if you do not wish to attack, then reloading your weapon takes an action.
:
Reloading as an ability means that your must use you ability action to reload your weapon.
:
Likewise, reloading as a reaction means that you must use your reaction to reload your weapon.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter VI: Equipment | Overview }}

\page

Reload free has no action economy cost and reloads as quickly as a bow. The only detriment is that a Reload weapon still takes two hands to reload.
:
You must always reload your weapon before using it for a ranged weapon attack again. If your weapon is empty at the end of your turn, it must be reloaded before you can use it again.
:
You have the choice of reloading your weapon with any of the options that are slower.

#### Thrown
Thrown weapons are used to make a ranged weapon attack by throwing them at the enemy, dealing their melee damage on hit unless a different damage value is listed after the Thrown weapon property.
:
You may draw and throw a weapon as part of the attack. If you throw a weapon without the Thrown property, the weapon is treated as an improvised weapon and may only cause a small amount of damage.

#### Trip
When you hit with a trip attack, you deal only your weapon ability modifier in damage on hit, and your enemy must succeed on its choice of an Athletics or Reflex Saving Throw or be knocked prone. If you land a critical hit, your weapon deals normal, non-critical damage in addition to forcing your enemy to roll the saving throw. Enemies a size category larger than you gain advantage on this save. Enemies two size categories larger than you are immune to being tripped in this way.

#### Two Handed
This weapon requires two hands to use when you attack with it. You can't use only one hand to attack with a two handed weapon.

#### Versatile
This weapon may be used with one or two hands and you can switch between them at any time. When used with two hands, you use the damage dice listed in parentheses.

The knuckle axe resembles an axe head with no handle, and either 4 finger holes or a curved handle to rest inside a closed fist. Masters with knuckle axes slash through soft targets much like a real axe, attacking two targets at once.

#### Side Baton

Often called a Tonfa, Riot Baton, or Arm Club, this defensive weapon is designed to deflect attacks with the forearm. It is a stout club with a perpendicular handle attached a third of the way down the length, allowing it to be swung out for a swipe, or extend the reach of a thrust. A master uses the handle as a hook just effectively as an axe and maximizes the defensive properties of this weapon.

#### Battle Axe

An axe about 2ft-3ft in length, with a longer beard designed for a wider slashing wound. This weapon is large enough to use with two hands for more powerful strikes, yet nimble enough to be used in one hand. Masters with the battle axe are stout and reliable with their bit, and throw the axe with a large overhand pitch with both hands at the base of the handle.

\column

#### Halberd

An axe blade topped with a spike mounted on an 8ft long shaft, with a hook on the back side of the axe blade for pulling mounted combatants from the saddle. With some experience, a halberd can be used to perform a trip against mounted foes to pull them from the saddle to a prone position, and the master has conquered this maneuver.

#### Handaxe

An incredibly versatile weapon and tool, the hand axe can be thrown, or used in melee, and can be used to trip your foe, and the master binds and disarms with lightning efficiency. If you have a handaxe on your person, you may gain advantage on survival checks where the handaxe can be used to help, such as cutting firewood or putting up tents.

#### Hook Sword

An exotic weapon made famous by the northern Chinese masters; a shortsword length weapon in which the tip forms a prominent hook, and which the knuckle guard features a crescent shaped blade. A hook sword can easily catch weapons and limbs, giving it superior control over an enemy's movements.
:
The master can also join two hook swords together for a unique means of trapping and binding enemies, as well as striking further by forming a makeshift flail; letting go of one hook sword and swinging it by the hook of the other sword. Hooking the swords together, or unhooking and wielding them separately can be taken as part of an attack. When you hook two hook swords together, your weapon gains Reach and loses Light. While wielded in this way, your hook swords count as one weapon instead of dual wielding two weapons.

| Master Ability | When you are hit with a melee weapon attack, as a reaction you can make a disarm or entangle attack against that enemy. |

#### Khopesh

This hybrid axe and sword was made famous by ancient Egyptians. It is a sword built with a large crescent shaped protrusion about one third from the tip, and a hooked tip, forming a sort of question mark shape. It acts similarly to a handaxe, but is lighter and can more reliably cut with a larger surface area. A Master with the Khopesh has learned to use the hooked point to hamstring enemies with ease.

| Master Ability | If you hit with a trip attack, your enemy's speed is reduced by 10ft until the end of their next turn. While they have this penalty, they suffer disadvantage to Athletic checks. |

\column

#### Poleaxe

An infantry weapon designed for use against armored foes, characterized by an axe on one side and a hammer on the other, tipped with a dagger-like spike from the top. It is typically on a 6 ft haft, shod with iron to protect it from damage. Though not long enough for a reach weapon, its style resembles that of a quarterstaff and axe combined. A master uses the weapon's iron shodding more actively, blocking attacks that would normally chop through the wood shaft.

| Master Ability | You gain +1 weapon AC and you may add your weapon ability bonus to deflect rolls. |

#### Tomahawk

Also called a fransisca, this small axe features a slimmer blade more balanced for throwing, and an opposing spike or small hammer so both sides of the weapon were dangerous in flight.
:
Tomahawks are balanced for throwing further distances than any other axe, and the master throws them with great force, using the hammer or spike's weight to drive the thinner axe head deeper into a target and throw them off balance or strike their arm mid swing.

#### Bar Mace

A stout, arm length iron bar lined with spikes or flanges, more able to utilize prying leverage to deal with armored foes. Designed for low skilled military soldiers, a master uses the many angles to pry weapons from the enemy's hands.

#### Bo Staff

The Japanese bo is a much smaller and thinner version of the quarterstaff, and the result is a much faster fighting style, devoted to quick successive strikes and acrobatic lunges. The master can turn one opening into a strike for two and has learned to deflect even powerful blows with a simple wooden stick.

#### Heavy Club

A larger mass weapon, much like a bat or ball mace. A master can target the foe's head more easily, disorienting and disabling their foes with a wound-up swing for the fences.

| Master Ability | If you score a critical hit, your enemy must succeed on a Constitution check or suffer disadvantage to all attacks and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |

#### Light Club

A simple sap or a metal bar, many clubs used for combat are designed to be thrown. Some light clubs are designed for policing, intended to be less-than-lethal, while others can be shorn in spikes or sharpened rings with a broad spiked tip. A master is extremely accurate at a foe's head to knock them off balance.

| Master Ability | When you score a critical hit, your foe must succeed on a Constitution check or suffer disadvantage to its Fortitude and Wisdom based ability checks until the end of your next turn. |

#### Mallet

Typically a crafter's tool, consisting of a shallow cylinder on a short handle. The lighter, faster bludgeon takes unique opportunities that other bludgeons would miss. A master uses the lightness of a mallet for a quick strike that sends the enemy reeling.

| Master Ability | If you choose the attack action, as a bonus action, you can make a shove attempt which, if successful, deals this weapon's damage. |

\column

#### Morningstar

An infantry weapon in the form of a thick wooden shaft up to 8 feet in length, slightly fluted toward the top, with a spiked head and topped with a stout iron spike. This reach weapon gives infantry an advantage against armored opponents without needing to learn advanced techniques, enabling simple militias to protect themselves from armor. A master with a morning star can absolutely ruin armor, rendering it less effective for its wearer.

| Master Ability | If you score a critical hit, your target's armor bonus to their AC is reduced by 1. This effect can stack until the target has no armor bonus to their AC, and is not removed until the armor has been repaired |

#### Quarterstaff

A quarterstaff is a heavier, thicker staff, meant for more weight and power in blocking than quick strikes in succession. Sometimes shod in iron, this staff provides increased protection for the master, able to use its shodding and length to provide a more stable means of defense.

#### Bladed Bow

Two curved blades affixed to longbow length limbs. Though not nearly as stout as a quarterstaff due to the flexibility of the bow itself, it is nonetheless an effective way to fight the close enemy. The bladed bow is very specialized and requires dedicated training to be anything but clumsy but in the hands of a master, the blade bow can protect a retreat as easily as it can press a melee attack.

| Master Ability | While holding this weapon, your movement does not incur opportunity attacks. |

\column

#### Compound

About the size of a shortbow, but has two pulleys on the limbs which allow the user to load exponentially more force. Because of the added mechanical aspect, loading is a bit slower than loading other bows, but its stopping power punches like a crossbow. A master can overdraw the pulleys to punch through targets like a crossbow.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter VI: Equipment | Bows and Slings }}

\page

#### Greatbow

Much taller and stouter than the longbow, easily reaching 6ft-8ft in length and as thick as a quarterstaff. It launches specialized great arrows that are similar in size to a javelin. Due to its size, javelins and ballista bolts can be used as ammunition, but with disadvantage to the attack roll. Greatbow masters can overdraw the stout poundage, sending enemies flying back. You must have a Strength score of at least 13 to wield a Greatbow.

| Master Ability | When you score a critical hit, you also force your target to save against knockback. All creatures that are flying have disadvantage on this save. |

#### Longbow 

A larger bow than the shortbow, consisting of 5ft-6ft limbs, thick sinew cording bowstring, and a longer powerstroke. Perhaps a bit cumbersome in close combat and atop a mount, even so, a master archer steadies their aim in any situation, ignoring distractions which may impede accuracy.

| Master Ability | If you suffer disadvantage for any reason, you can use your ability action to negate your disadvantage until the end of your turn. You no longer suffer disadvantage to attacks made beyond normal range. |

\column

#### Recurve 

Usually shorter, in the 3ft-4ft range, but with a longer power stroke than a shortbow of its size. Each limb curves away from the wielder at its ends, effectively loading twice the elastic power into the arrow. Due to the shorter overall size but higher draw, the master can load an extra arrow into the recurve and attack two different targets.

| Master Ability | You can loose two arrows at once with the same power. Once on each of your turns when you make a recurve attack, you can make another recurve attack against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within normal range. |

#### Shortbow

A simple bow about 3ft in length, more suited to close combat, as its smaller size lends itself to agile movement and quick targeting on either side of the body. Masters with the shortbow can make snap shots as quickly as any swordsman reacts to an opening.

#### Sling

A simple leather cup swung about the body to release a stone with circular momentum. You can launch anything that can fit in the cup; bombs, potions, poisons, even rounded stones, but do so with -1 to the attack. You may also put something into the sling and make a melee attack with it, swinging the weapon like a flail. A master maximizes their power in the throw, and can disable and disorient an enemy with precise shots to the head.

| Master Ability | When you score a critical hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution check or suffer disadvantage to attacks until the end of its next turn. |

#### Wrist Shot

Instead of gathering circular momentum, this slingshot uses elastic material to launch anything a sling can without the penalty. A wrist shot is a favorite of smaller folk, more easily able to conceal the weapon and able to make use of ranged attacks with smaller arms and generally weaker stature. Masters with wrist shots can target weak points and make it easier for their allies to land critical blows.

#### Broadsword

True broadswords have a wider blade to add power to the cut, and often perform more like an axe in the strike. Examples include the messer, cleaver sword, or Chinese dadao. A master strikes through soft targets, driving their momentum to other targets.

| Master Ability | When you score a critical hit or reduce a target to 0 hit points, you can make another attack to another target within 5ft, as part of the same action. This effect can happen multiple times as long as the criteria are met. |

#### Falchion

Descended from the broadsword, the cusped tip and straight blade was a later period design but iconic in appearance, and this two handed version represents the pinnacle of its design. A master maximizes the falchion's cutting power, striking soft targets with critical accuracy.

\column

#### Greatsword

Often as tall as its wielder, spanning in the 5ft-6ft range with a 2ft handle and a lengthy, wide blade. The long blade, lengthy handle, and added weight make the greatsword one of the most damaging melee weapons in use, and can easily dispatch larger targets with ease. A master finds the greatest weapon to use against a large enemy is the greatsword.

| Master Ability | Against category size Large and larger targets, your damage is 2d12, instead of 2d10. |

#### Katana

A single edged blade, slightly curved with a minimal guard and a long handle. The longer handle and curved edge provide greater leverage for more effective deflections. A master deflects even powerful blows with ease.

#### Longsword

A multipurpose sword with a wide guard for dueling, heavy pommel for balance, and a fine, rapier point. Generally a hand and a half handle, this sword is favored by spellblades for its ease of use in one hand or two. Masters become devastatingly accurate, standing up to even master duelists.

#### Montante

A long greatsword made famous by western Europeans, similar to a polearm in reach and technique thanks to a handle above the guard called a ricasso. The master has learned the famous protection technique, keeping an ally safe with expert application of refined angles and parries.

| Master Ability | On your turn, you can use your reaction to enter a protective stance. Until the start of your next turn, all attacks against allies within your reach suffer disadvantage. |

#### Odachi

The famous horse killer blade from late period Japan, the odachi is the greatsword of the east. Its curved cutting edge and huge handle give the master a perfect balance of defense and offense missing from western styles.

| Master Ability | You deal one additional damage die to your target if you attack a different target than your previous attack. |

\column

#### Scimitar

A single-handed curved sword, with generally more weight in the blade than the pommel. The added agility and pommel weight give the master a sweeping, mobile fighting style that benefits from flowing movement over rigid stance.

| Master Ability | If you travel at least 20ft or are mounted, your next attack deals an additional d8 damage. |

#### Short Glaive

A glaive weapon with a shorter handle, usually in the range of length of a greatsword, but much lighter as the metal blade is smaller and more than half of the weapon is wooden haft. A short glaive is favored among elven armies as an effective long weapon that is both heavy hitting and light enough to use with finesse. Masters are lightning fast, quickly taking advantage of a miss to make an offensive opening.

#### War Sword

Child of the Longsword and Greatsword, this sword's length lies between the two, combining both styles. A master deals greater damage against larger targets like the Greatsword, with deft precision of the tip much like a Longsword.

#### Blowgun

A tube used to launch a needle dart with your breath. The dart is small and silent, and if you make an attack from stealth and miss, your location is not revealed. A master uses the art of the flying viper, shooting two darts at once and reloading with a single hand.

\column

#### Hand Crossbow

#### Mauler

Two bows mounted in an X shape to a tiller which holds three bolts. Even with four prods, the bolts fly with less power than a hand crossbow and don’t group well at distance, but have incredible stopping power up close. Masters group the bolts at weak points with devastating effect.
:
Because the bolts spread over distance, the damage is only 1d4+1 on medium or smaller size targets outside normal range, as only the top bolt is on target. All three bolts hit Large and larger creatures at any range.

:
A deployable stand can be purchased for 150g. As an action, you mount the ballista to the stand. While mounted, its reload is an object interaction, but you cannot move it until you use another action to unmount it.

#### Repeating Crossbow

Repeaters have a weaker draw strength to allow the user to draw with one hand by pulling a lever along the bottom much like a modern shotgun. It holds 6 bolts and once depleted, you must spend an action to refill the magazine. The master has learned to shoot as they pull the reload lever, dumping shots into a target with speed.

#### Smallsword

A needle-like blade with a narrow profile and a fine tip for fitting between plates of armor, often given a dome shaped guard to protect the hands while thrusting. The master has such control and poise that any distraction or detriment can be ignored with enough focus on the target.

#### Sword Breaker

A short weapon with notches on its spine, designed to catch, disarm, and in extreme cases, break the enemy's weapon. The master can disarm in an instant, and with another weapon, possibly break the enemy's sword.

#### Double Flail

Two flail heads, each with a separate chain attached to a single handle, whether they are attached at opposing ends, or attached at the same end. The Double flail is a difficult weapon to use effectively, and only the master really gets use out of individual heads, turning a potential miss into a new opportunity.

If you have advantage and both dice hit, add your weapon ability modifier twice to the damage total. |

#### Light Flail

The familiar 2lb spiked ball at the end of a length of chain, attached to a short iron or wooden haft usually similar in length to a handaxe. The light flail sees lightning fast attacks turned into a great boon for the master, carrying the weapons speed and momentum into another attack if they miss.

\column

#### Heavy Flail

A large spiked metal bar attached to a long handle, allowing one or two handed usage. The massive head and lengthy chain put it in the same sphere of war as the warhammer and battle axe. A master's binding and tripping attacks still harm their target if the enemy resists the maneuver.

#### Nunchaku

The nunchaku is two rods bound by a rope or chain. By whipping around the body, a master can make lightning fast attacks to wield it like a Double Ended weapon.

#### Trisectional Staff

A quarterstaff cut into three sections, each connected with a small length of chain or rope. A master uses this weapon's double hinges to strike in unpredictable ways, tripping or entangling with either end of the weapon.

\column

#### Whip

The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15ft reach. You can use a whip to grasp unattended small objects, or any reasonable handhold within range and if possible, you can pull the object to you. A whip master treats their whips as extensions of their hands.

| Master Ability | When you disarm any creature, you choose to place the item anywhere in your reach, or use your reaction to catch it. An item in your reach that can be grabbed with the whip can be placed anywhere else in your reach. |

#### Whip Sword

A whip sword can be either a sword or a bladed whip. As an ability action, you change between the forms of your weapon. As a sword, it is similar to a longsword. As a whip, it gains reach, utility, and a target entangled by you takes your weapon's damage. A master can quickly change between forms as needed to attack enemies near their entangled prey.

#### Light Hammer

A short-handled hammer about the size of a handaxe and just as balanced for throwing. While a mace may shred armor, a hammer delivers precise blows that weaken the enemy, and a master can disorient the opponent for follow up attacks.

| Master Ability | When you score a critical hit, the enemy suffers a d6 penalty to their next check of any ability. |

#### Light Pick

A long, thin pick, mounted to a short haft, capable of precise, targeted piercing attacks that punch through armor with ease. Though not as stout as a war pick, the light pick allows more agile maneuvers, as well as balanced throwing. A master looks for the perfect opening, placing the pick into soft targets or between plates where armor is lacking.

| Master Ability | Your Penetrate property ignores 3/4 of your target's armor bonus to their Armor Class. |

\column

#### Lucerne

A pole mounted, pronged hammer head for crushing blows on one side and a vicious hooking spike head for piercing and peeling armor on the other. The long haft allows the wielder to put devastating force behind the blows of this weapon. Lucerne masters swing at angles which force their enemies to choose between sacrificing equipment or flesh.

| Master Ability | If your enemy succeeds on the save from your Trip attack, they instead take normal weapon damage. |

#### Maul

A massive weapon near the size of a greataxe with an immensely weighted head, the maul can send foes staggering from even attempting to block such a massive weapon. Mauls always gain advantage when rolling an attack to destroy an object. The master finds the best ways to bully their opponents with the weight of this massive weapon.

Creatures one size category larger than you do not gain advantage on the save, and you may attempt to knockback creatures two size categories larger, though they gain advantage on the save. Creatures three size categories larger than you are immune as usual. |

#### Stiletto

A thin, round spike with a thin point and round cross section make it perfect for fitting between or outright puncturing through metal plates or rings. A master employs a host of grappling techniques as follow ups to their initial attacks.

| Master Ability | When your enemy is entangled, you can use your ability action to attempt a shove. |

#### Wall Pick

Similar in size to the light pick, with a longer, hooked spike to aid in climbing. In combat, the hook is used to grapple or disarm enemies while still able to puncture and pierce armor. A wall pick gives you advantage on climb checks and you can climb onto creatures any size category bigger than you. The master can grapple a foe as easily as they latch onto a wall.

| Master Ability | If your entangle attack misses, you can reroll the attack once but must take the new roll. If you roll a critical hit, your enemy is restrained and grappled. |

\column

#### War Hammer

Historically a lightweight, long-handled weapon around 3ft-4ft in length, designed to damage armored enemies. The small, pronged hammer head is often backed with a military pick or different style of face. A master of the warhammer carries momentum into each attack to send foes reeling.

| | |

| Experience | One Handed, Melee, Penetrate, Versatile |
| Master     | One Handed, Melee, Penetrate, Versatile |
| Expert     | One Handed, Melee, Penetrate, Versatile |
| Master Ability | If you move at least 10ft in a straight line before your attack, your attack ignores an additional 1 AC if wielding it one handed, or 2 AC if two handing your war hammer. On a critical hit, your weapon damages the target's armor, permanently decreasing the armor class until the armor is repaired |

#### War Pick

A weaponized miner's pick, famously invented by militant mountain dwarves, refined worldwide for use against armored infantries. The pick comes in many forms but is usually a battle axe sized weapon with a reinforced spike on one end, and a narrow hammer opposite the spike. The master can strike vital areas, puncturing deeply to bleed the target out over time.

| | |
|:-----------|:------|

| Master     | One Handed, Melee, Penetrate, Puncture, Trip |
| Expert     | One Handed, Melee, Penetrate, Puncture, Trip |
| Master Ability | If you score a critical hit your enemy begins to bleed. Roll a d10. At the start of its turn, the target takes this value as piercing damage, and takes 1 less each subsequent turn until 0 piercing damage. This damage stops if they receive any healing, or they spend an action to staunch the bleeding. If a target is affected by this bleeding damage, an additional critical hit will increase the bleed damage by your roll of a d10. It is up to your DM if your target is capable of bleeding. |

#### Bladed Staff

A 6' staff weapon with a sword on each end, usually straight, but curved varieties exist. A bladed staff can be used to great effect, creating space around the wielder in a skirmish, or used as an effective spear with a wicked butt end. The master is able to attack as quickly with two blades as others are with only one, in lightning rapid fire strikes that take full advantage of the weapon's reach.

#### Glaive

Perhaps the simplest of the polearms, a glaive is a short sword blade mounted on a long pole, used like a spear or a greatsword, the wide, sweeping slashes become useful for dealing with enemies much bigger than the wielder. While originally designed to be used by infantry against cavalry, in the hands of a master, a glaive is quite effective as a giant killer.

\column

#### Guisarme

A sharpened and sturdy pruning hook, developed as a peasant weapon from modifying a farm tool. The curved hook of the blade allows the guisarme to be used as a tripping weapon or to pull foes from the saddle. A guisarme is a favorite of common militias who will face cavalry in battle, as the master can pull a knight from the saddle with relative ease.

#### Lajatang

A rare and unusual double ended weapon, consisting of a 3-5ft shaft and a crescent blade fitted at each end, with the points of the crescents pointing away from the haft of the weapon, giving it essentially 2 outward facing spear points on each end. Lajatang masters are extremely rare, but are a whirling dervish of crescent blades and points, dangerous from all sides.

| Master Ability | On your turn, you can spend your reaction to enter a Defensive Stance, negating any flanking bonus or ability any enemy might have for flanking you or having the enemy's ally near you, such as pack tactics or sneak attack. You may use Double Ended twice on your turn, but your second attack must be against a different target than your first. |

#### Partisan

Much like a Glaive design, this pole weapon is essentially a shortsword blade mounted to a long haft, but keeps a wide cross guard at the base of the blade, trading sweeping cuts for defensive guards. The master Partisan uses the guard of their weapon like a shield at distance, and can even use it to protect allies.

\column

#### War Scythe

Whether mounted horizontally like a traditional farming implement, or mounted vertically like a glaive, a war scythe has its roots in a peasant militia looking to arm itself in times of war. A scythe in the right hands can be useful in combat, though it takes a practiced master to be truly effective. The master uses the scythe's reaping motion to deal horrible slashing wounds to the foes they trip in combat.

#### Godendag

A short spear with a heavy ball socket to hold the spear point, making use of sweeping bludgeons and weighted piercing attacks. The master makes full use of the added weight for powerful blows that set their enemy off balance.

| Master Ability | If you score a critical hit, the next attack against this target gains advantage. |

#### Harpoon

A barbed throwing spear with a welded ring, attached to a length of rope or chain so the target or harpoon can be retrieved. This weapon comes with 50ft of silk rope, which is reflected in the cost and weight. A master of the harpoon impales with ease and can swiftly reel in a harpooned prey.
:
On a hit, your enemy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be impaled, while a critical hit always impales.

| Master Ability | You drag an enemy toward you up to 20 feet, and your target suffers disadvantage to Strength while while it is impaled. |

#### Javelin

A light throwing spear balanced for flight but sturdy enough as a simple spear. A master can make an Olympian throw, puncturing shields so deeply, the enemy must pry the remnants out before it can be of any use in combat.

| Master Ability | When you score a critical, the target suffers a -2 AC penalty. On its turn an enemy can use an action to succeed on an Athletics check to pry the javelin free, destroying it in the process. |

#### Lance

Designed to unseat mounted enemies from the saddle, while on foot a lance imposes disadvantage against targets within 5ft, but while mounted gains One Handed and Penetrate. Masters leverage their mount's strength, allowing for devastating blows that knock enemies to the ground.

#### Ravenbeak

This pike has a crescent blade on the side of the tip used to hook or slash. The added hook reduces the spear's penetration, but its utility makes up the difference. The master can redirect attacks and disarm with ease.

| Master Ability | You can use your deflect property within your normal thrown range, and for any creature of your choice. |

#### Net

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until freed. It has no effect on creatures that are formless or Huge or larger. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC10) ends the restrained condition and destroys the net. Masters can toss the net in a way that tangles it around their prey, making it much harder to escape.

| Master Ability | 	The net's AC is increased by 10. If you have advantage on an entangle attack, your target has disadvantage on the check made to escape. |

\column

#### Throwing Knife

Small, balanced knives with a broad piercing tip and sharpened pommel, no longer than 4"-6". Easily hidden, these blades offer more range than throwing stars due to the higher weighted pommel. A master has perfected the art of quick throws at their enemy's hands or arms as they swing a weapon, causing the knife to interfere with their attack.

| | |

| Master Ability | You can choose to deal only your weapon ability modifier in damage, but force your target to succeed on a Reflex check or lose its reaction and suffer disadvantage on its next attack roll. |

#### Throwing Shot

Though not strictly their invention, the technique to throw an iron ball in combat was pioneered by the Orcs. Not many can stand up to the heavy iron in flight. A master is deadly accurate with the shot and is able to target an enemy's head to stun if they have an advantage. A creature with Strength less than 13 cannot wield a shot at all.

| Master Ability | If you have advantage and both dice would have hit, or if you score a critical hit, your enemy must succeed on a Constitution check or be stunned until the end of its next turn. If you have disadvantage but one dice would have hit, deal your weapon ability modifier in damage, though this still counts as a miss. |

#### Throwing Star

Star shaped metal disks made to be palmed together and thrown as a pepper of smaller strikes to disable an enemy before a followup attack. The flat, small design of these weapons allows many to be palmed at once and thrown all together. A master has the capability to dance in a quick circle, throwing stars at all foes around them.

## Armor

This section describes the basic armors available in Natural Progressions. Armors directly affect your character's Armor Class, and generally is the second biggest modifier behind your reflex skill modifier. As stated above, your Armor Class is calculated as follows:
:
10 + armor bonus + weapon bonus + shield bonus + reflex skill modifier
:
Unlike weapons and skills, armors do not have a skill modifier that increase with a natural 20. The reflex skill modifier fulfills this role for the Armor Class calculation.
:
However, like weapons, there are different types of armors: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. In order to use any of these types of armor, you need to be trained in them - a character is either trained or untrained in each type of armor. This training status is gotten by your Race/Culture, Background and Class.
:
Additionally, your type of armor can affect your stealth skill - some armors give disadvantage to stealth checks while being worn.

{{wide
### Light Armor
| Type | AC Bonus | Stealth | Weight | Gold Cost |
|:-----|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Padded | 1 | Disadvantage | 4 | 5 |
| Leather | 1 | None | 5 | 10 |
| Studded | 2 | None | 6 | 45 |
| Lacquered | 3 | Disadvantage | 6 | 300 |
}}

#### Padded
Thick padding made of quilted fabrics or furs, this armor provides little more than slight protection from incidental contact, and restricts the wearer's movement.

#### Leather
Moderately thin, unhardened utility leather that offers slight protection but is cheap and flexible.

\column

#### Studded Leather
Thick, hard leather hide that has been studded with metal rivets or scales. The increased time and material to stud the leather adds to the manufacturing cost.

#### Lacquered Leather
This leather has been boiled in wax or water and painted with lacquer to toughen it as hard as modern plastics. It offers superior protection to other light armors, but the required skill to create it greatly adds to the cost. Additionally, the hard plates create more noise than softer armors, leaving much to be desired by stealthy assassins.

{{wide
### Medium Armor
| Type | AC Bonus | Stealth | Weight | Gold Cost |
|:-----|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Chain Shirt | 3 | Disadvantage | 10 | 50 |
| Ring Mail | 4 | None | 12 | 100 |
| Breastplate | 5 | None | 10 | 300 |
| Banded Mail | 6 | Disadvantage | 20 | 500 |
}}

#### Chain Shirt
This simple shirt of butted mail is easy to produce as the rings aren't welded closed. A chain shirt covers less than a hauberk but is lighter and more affordable.

#### Ring Mail
A pattern of closed rings stitched to a thick leather backing. This armor takes about as long as a Chain shirt to make and is similar in cost, but due to the combined protection of the leather backing and metal rings, offers greater protection than either one separately. Unfortunately, this combined armor is more restrictive.

\column

#### Breastplate
Wearing just the breastplate of a suit of plate armor, this armor provides the easiest mobility of the medium armors and more protection than the chain shirt or ring mail. However, plate is expensive to make and thus has a greatly increased cost.

#### Banded Mail
The quintessential half-plate, also known as lorica, this armor is a series of metal ribbons banded together to form more complete protection. Banded mail is cheaper to produce than full plate, but is still quite a process, involving many steel plates and precise shaping.

### Heavy Armor
| Type | AC Bonus | Stealth | Weight | Gold Cost |
|:-----|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Hauberk | 5 | Disadvantage |25 | 150 |
| Scale Mail | 6 | Disadvantage | 30 | 300 |
| Split | 7 | Disadvantage | 33 | 750 |
| Plate | 8 | Disadvantage | 40 | 1500 |
}}

#### Hauberk
A full coat of chainmail made with durable, riveted or welded rings in a tight weave. The Hauberk covers both arms and stops at the knee, offering near complete coverage.

#### Scale
Adding a scale to each ring in a hauberk gives a substantial increase to protection without much increase in the manufacturing but adds quite a bit of weight.

#### Splint
Splint armor can be described as the poor man’s plate. Instead of plates shaped to fit, a series of small, palm-sized plates and finger sized “splints” of metal are tied together to form a coat. It is cheaper to produce but is not as durable.

#### Plate
Plate is extremely difficult and costly to produce, however, no other armor is more protective. All parts of the body are covered, even the wearer's joints.

## Shields

Like armor, shields are a part of the Armor Class calculation and do not have an ability modifier associated with them - characters are trained or untrained with Shields.
:
Unlike armor, characters still get the AC Bonus associated with each shield if they are untrained.
:
For every shield, there is a time to don, and that can be different depending if the shield is held or strapped. Shields that are strapped cannot be disarmed, however, a strapped shield is considered using the shield with one hand. This does mean that in order to perform an activity, such as wielding a Great Sword, you would need to doff any shield you are using.

{{wide
| Shield | AC Bonus | Stealth | Don (strapped) | Don (Held) | Weight | Cost |
|:-------|:--------:|:-------:|:--------------:|:----------:|:------:|:----:|
| Arm Guard | 1 | Normal | N/A | Free | 1 | 10 |

}}

#### Arm Guard
A fully enclosed arm shield that often had a sword built into is construction to make a gauntlet sword called a pata. Without an attached weapon, the hand which has an arm guard equipped can be used to help wield a weapon or assist with Reload, but cannot be used to wield a weapon by itself; in this case it must be attached to the arm guard. The master has perfected this fighting style.
:
When trained with Arm Guards, you may attach a light weapon to an arm guard as part of a rest using smith's tools. The weapon gains the affixed property but can't be removed without smith's tools.

#### Buckler

A buckler, or target, is a hand shield used by duelists and fencers for its small profile and ease of counter attacks while deflecting. The master's trained duelist techniques set them up for the perfect riposte.
:
When trained with Bucklers, bucklers gain the Deflect (d8) weapon trait.

#### Diskarmor

An esoteric weapon of gnomish invention, a diskarmor is a round shield attached to a chain mechanism that retracts quickly after the chain reaches its length to make essentially a shield yo-yo. The user can toss it out to wield it like a large flail, then retract it to be used as a shield again.
:
When trained with Diskarmors, the shield games the following properties: One Handed, Melee d6, Entangle, Reach, Trip. Diskarmor deals bludgeoning damage. A diskarmor is not considered a weapon.

#### Kite

Kite shields are as wide as the wielder's torso but extend downward with a point or oval extension to protect the legs, which can also be used offensively to knock an enemy off guard.
:
When trained with Kite sheilds, you gain advantage on any ability check made to resist being knocked prone or moved along the ground.

#### Pavise

A pavise is a lighter tower shield with a central spike to drive into the ground, or a set of legs to allow the shield to stand freely. While deployed, you can use it as cover. Unfortunately it is unwieldable as a normal shield, only able to be worn on the back. While wearing it, you are unable to equip any other shield.
:
While deployed, a Pavise can be knocked down if the enemy succeeds on an Athletics Check against your Weapon DC. As an ability action you can pick up a pavise and either deploy it again or don it on your back.
:
When trained with Pavise shields, as an ability action, you can drive the shield into the ground, essentially creating an obstacle on the battlefield. When in the 5 x 5 square directly behind the embedded shield, you gain +3 to your armor class (rather than +1), and you are considered covered by the shield. The

#### Skirmish

Skirmish shields come in a variety of shapes but are about the size of the user's torso. A Skirmish shield is large enough to provide better passive protection than the buckler, while still providing the agility missing with a tower shield. The master can extend this agility to even spell attacks and can offensively use the edge of their shield.
:
When trained with Skirmish shields, you gain an additional +2 shield AC against ranged weapon and spell attacks.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter VI: Equipment | Shields }}

\page

#### Spiked

A spiked shield is a blanket term for all weaponized shields, with spikes on the face and either a spiked or bladed edge. Somewhat cumbersome compared to a skirmish shield with the added weaponization, a spiked shield is hard to be stealthy and agile with.
:
When trained with spiked shields, the shield has the following properties: One Handed, Melee d6, Brace, Puncture, Thrown (20/60). Spiked shield deals piercing or slashing damage. A spiked shield is not considered a weapon.

#### Tower

This massive shield is as tall as you and just as wide; you more fight around it like a door as a piece of mobile cover. The master shieldman can take cover at a moment's notice, effectively giving the enemy no target.
:
When trained with tower shields and using the shield as cover, if you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Reflex check, and you fail that check, you take only half damage.

# Chapter VII: Magic and Spellcasting

In many settings, magic permeates the world. It shapes not only the narrative of any given campaign, but also the world itself. The following chapter will discuss both the rules surrounding spell casting, as well as general information regarding spells.

## Spell Rules

A spell is a specific magic effect, bounded by the rules set forth in this chapter and the rules given for the specific spell as well. One should not confuse *magical features* with spells - the two can appear to be completely identical, but are bounded by a different set of rules.

### Armor

In order to cast while wearing armor, a caster must be Trained in the type of armor they are wearing. Otherwi

### Casting Time

All spells have a casting time. Most spells are an action to cast, but some have a different casting time. Some of the more common casting times are as follow:

 - Action
 - Bonus Action
 - Part of an Attack (action)
 - Part of Movement
 - Reaction
 - 1 minute
:
When casting, you must complete the casting uninterrupted before the spell effects occur. Generally speaking, for spells that take an action or less to cast, one will not be interrupted.

### Casting Range

All spells have a range to their effects. Some are miniscule, effectively only making oneself a target for the spell. Others have massive ranges, allowing a caster to target something miles away.

### Components

In order to access the magic needed to cast a spell, different components may be needed.

#### Material (M)

Some spells require physical objects in order to be cast. The items generally are not valuables, but random objects that one may find laying around, or out in nature. These objects are then consumed by the spell. Due to this requirement, many casters carry around component pouches, holding the items they require for casting.

##### Spellcasting Focus

Some spellcasters do not carry around component pouches. Instead, they have a spellcasting focus, which takes the place of material components that do not have a cost associated with them. Spellcasting focuses are magical objects, typically in the form of an amulet or another piece of jewelry.
:
Some spellcastings use spellcasting foci better fitting to their surroundings - wizards tend to use their spellbook as a spellcasting focus, and clerics, their holy book.

#### Somatic (S)

Other spells require specific hand motions to be cast. Without the movement, the spell effects do not occur. This does mean that a caster who is Grappled or Restrained cannot cast spells with a Somatic requirement.

#### Verbal (V)

Finally, some spells require the uttering of magical words. Spells with a verbal component cannot be cast if a character cannot make the sounds to fulfill the requirement.

### Duration

The effects of a spell can last a variable amount of time. Unless otherwise specified, it is assumumed a spell is instantaneous

#### Concentration

Some spells require the caster to concentrate on the spell effects. These spells have a maximum duration defined before a caster's concentration is broken. The caster can choose to break concentration earlier as part of any other action.
:
While the effects of a concentration spell are active, a caster cannot cast another concentration spell without breaking the existing concentration. Likewise, if a caster is knocked unconscious or killed, they lose concentration.
:
For every instance of damage taken while cocentrating on a spell, a caster must make a Mental Fortitude Saving Throw against a DC of the damage taken. If they fail, they lose concentration.

#### Instantaneous

An instantaneous spell is cast, it's effects are instantly applied, and the spell is done. The magic from the spell only exists the moment the spellcasting finishes.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter VII: Magic and Spellcasting | Spell Rules }}

\page

### Mana

All spells have a set mana amount. You must have enough mana in order to cast a spell. Once a spell is cast, you expend the required amount of mana.

### Targets

A spell may have a specific set of items and creatures you can target. In order to target a creature fitting the requirements, they must be within the spell's range, you must be able to see the creature and have an unobstructed path to the target.

#### Area of Effect (AOE)

Some spells cause AOE effects, allowing them to hit multiple targets within the range of the AOE. Spells that cause these types of effects have a shape defining the tiles affected, as well as a point of origin, which is where the effect starts.
:
AOE effects are generally blocked by full cover, such a wall, but tend to go through half cover, such as a bush.

##### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. The point of origin must be within range of the spell, and the cone extends to the range of the spell. If the spell dictates a size of the cone, only point of origin must be within the range of the spell.
:
Unless otherwise specified, the cone's angle is 45°. If a square is at least half-way covered by the cone, it is considered within the area of the cone.

##### Line

A line extends from the point of origin to the range of the spell, assuming it doesn't hit an object that would be considered full cover. The point of origin does not need to be the caster, and can be anywhere within range of the spell.

##### Sphere

The point of origin of a sphere is the exact center. If the sphere does not have a specified size, the point of origin must be yourself, and the spell extends out to the range of the spell.
:
If the sphere does have a size, the point of origin must be within the range of the spell, but the entire sphere does not need to be within range.

##### Star

The point of origin of a star is the exact center, where the spell is targetting. From here, the target radiates out by the radius defined in all 8 directions, in straight lines.
:
Any creature falling on the line within the radius defined by the spell is hit.

## Casting a Spell

Now that the rules and requirements in order to cast a spell have been described, the following are rules regarding what happens when a spell is actually cast.

### Attack Roll vs Saving Throw

Many spells will require an attack roll, a Saving Throw or both. If either are required, the spell will dictate which is needed, as well as the DC to pass it.
:
The attack rolls of spells are calculated as 1d20 + your modifier for the school of magic. The spell will dictate if it's a melee or ranged attack. These attacks follow the standard attack rules as outlined in Chapter IX. 
:
Spells that require a Saving Throw by their target will have a specified DC to beat. Generally, the DC will be your spellcasting DC, which is 10 + your spellcasting for the school of magic.

### Overlapping Effects

Many spells have similar, or even the same, effects as another spell. If a character is affected by two spells giving them the same effects (the strength of the effects can vary), the will only be affected by the more potent of the two effects.

## Schools of Magic

It is believed that all magic falls into one of the below schools. Each school has its own unqiue properties, which binds each spell within the school together.

### Abjuration

Abjuration spells are protective in nature, although they can be used aggressively. The create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers or banish creatures to other planes of existence. This school tends to hold all blessings.

### Conjuration

Conjuration spells transport and summon objects from one location to another. Some spells transports objects from one place to another, while others summon objects out of thin air.

### Divination

Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.

{{footnote Chapter VII: Magic and Spellcasting | Casting A Spell }}

\page

### Enchantment

Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a freid, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
:
Those who generally use enchantment face the fear and ire of others. If the schools of magic were to be rated on a good-evil scale, Enchantment magic would be rated as the most evil.

### Evocation

Evocation spells manipuate magic to produce an effect. These effects generally are deadly.

### Illusion

Illusion spells deceive the sense or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or the remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

### Malediction

Malediction spells curse others. They cause people to grow weak, unable to defend themselves.

### Necromancy

Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life from another craeture, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.

### Transmutation

Transmutation sdpells change the properties of a creature, object or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from an injury.

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.

:
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

:
If the effect of a higher level than this spell is cast, you must roll a d20 and add your Abjuration Spellcasting Modifier against a DC of 10 + the normal casting amount of one level lower than the effect's level, rounded up. For instance, a magical effect cast by a level 5 spell would have a DC of 18 (10 + 8 [the 8 comes from the standard 8 mana used to cast a level 4 spell]).

Dispel Magic cast at the sixth level will always remove the targetted effect.

At your touch, one curse affecting a creature or object is cured. Although this spell is technically a level 1 spell, it can be cast at any level, assuming you can cast spells at that level as well.
:
If the curse of a higher level than this spell is cast, you must roll a d20 and add your Abjuration Spellcasting Modifier against a DC of 10 + the normal casting amount of one level lower than the curse's level, rounded up. For instance, a curse of level 5 would have a DC of 18 (10 + 8 [the 8 comes from the standard 8 mana used to cast a level 4 spell). If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

:
You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
:
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Investigation Check against your Illusion Spell Save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

:
Aquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
:
Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

#### Animate Dead

**Duration:**     												:: Instantaneous
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Cleric, Wizard

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).
:
On each of your turns, you can use a Ability Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
:
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

#### Arcane Lock

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.
:
While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

#### Augury

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Minute
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana
**Range:**        												:: Self

**Duration:**     												:: Instantaneous
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Cleric

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
:
 - Weal, for good results
:
 - Woe, for bad results
:
 - Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
:
 - Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad
:
 - The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
:
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Cleric

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Mental Fortitude Saving Throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
:
You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
:
Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

#### Catapult

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8. The number rolled on the first d8 determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.
:
| d8 | Damage Type |
|:---|:-----------:|
| 1 | Acid |
| 2 | Cold |
| 3 | Fire |
| 4 | Force |

:
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Mental Fortitude Saving Throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.
:
The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.
:
On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Mental Fortitude Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

:
Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make an Athletics Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
:
As a Ability Action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Reflex Saving Throw.

#### Enlarge/Reduce
*2nd-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana
**Range:**        												:: 30 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a pinch of powdered iron)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Minute
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Sorcerer, Wizard

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Fortitude Saving Throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
:
If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.
:
Enlarge. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
:
Reduce. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Athletics Checks and Atheletics Saving Throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

#### Ensnaring Strike

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Ability Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana
**Range:**        												:: Self
**Components:**   												:: V
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Minute
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Druid
**Potential Damage Types:**								:: Piercing

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on an Athletics Saving Throw or be restrained by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.
:
While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make an Athletics Check against your Conjuration Spell Save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

#### Feather Fall
*2nd-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Reaction
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana

**Range:**        												:: 30 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S
**Duration:**     												:: Instantaneous
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Cleric, Druid, Wizard

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
:
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
:
When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
:
While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.
:
You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

**Components:**   												:: V,S
**Duration:**     												:: Instantaneous
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Artificer, Wizard

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
:
This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Reflex Saving Throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
:
As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.
:
When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse's eyes, which must remain there for the duration)
**Duration:**     												:: 10 Days
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Cleric, Wizard

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become undead.
:
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.

#### Grease
*2nd-level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana
**Range:**        												:: 60 Feet

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.

#### Gust of Wind
*2nd-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana
**Range:**        												:: 60 Feet

A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on an Athletics Saving Throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.
:
Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
:
The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
:
As a Ability Action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 3 mana
**Range:**        												:: Self
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a forked twig)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 10 Minutes
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard

Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.
:
The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Artificer, Bard, Wizard

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
:
When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
:
The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
:
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
:
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
:

#### Phantasmal Force
*3rd-level illusion*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 5 mana
**Range:**        												:: 60 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Minute
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Wizard
**Potential Damage Types:**								:: Psychic

You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Riddle or Insight Saving Throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
:
The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
:
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
:
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
:
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
:
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life.
:
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
:
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.
:
A creature affected by this spell makes another Constitution Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
:
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy.

Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
:
The target must make a Mental Fortitude Saving Throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
:
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Bestial Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
:
The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 5 mana

**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Wizard

You utter foul words, summoning demons from the chaos of the Abyss. Roll on the following table to determine what appears.

:
3-4	Four demons of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
:

The DM chooses the demons, such as manes or dretches, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
:
The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.
:
As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demons can't cross the circle or harm it, and they can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a Ability Action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition.

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Athletics Check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.
:
Object. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.
:
As a Ability Action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
:
Size	HP	AC	Attack	Str	Dex

Tiny	20	18	+8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage	4	18

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
:
If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
:
You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
:
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Mental Fortitude Saving Throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

#### Heroism
*5th-level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: Touch
**Components:**   												:: V,S
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Minute
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Cleric

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any remaining temporary hit points from this spell.

#### Locate Creature
*5th-level divination*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: Self
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Hour
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Cleric, Druid, Wizard

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.
:
The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.
:
This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

#### Major Image
*5th-level illusion*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: 120 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 10 Minutes
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Wizard

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).
:
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
:
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

#### Petrification
*5th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: Touch
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a small stone, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:**     												:: Instantaneous
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You touch a stone to a creature, and infuse the stone into the target. The target must make a Constitution Saving Throw. Upon a failure, the creature is Petrified.

#### Phantasmal Killer
*5th-level illusion*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: 120 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Minute
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Bard, Wizard
**Potential Damage Types:**								:: Psychic

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Mental Fortitude, Insight or Perception Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target becomes Frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Mental Fortitude, Insight or Perception Saving Throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

#### Polymorph
*5th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: 60 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a caterpillar cocoon)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Hour
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
:
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
:
The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
:
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
:
The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

#### Spell Shackle
*5th-level malediction*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: 300 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Minute
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Sorcerer, Wizard

You target a spell caster you can see. The target must make an Arcana Saving Throw, and upon a failure, take one point of damage for every 2 points of mana they spend.

#### Summon Elemental
*5th-level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: 90 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (air, a pebble, ash, and water inside a gold-inlaid vial worth at least 400 gp)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Hour
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Druid, Wizard

You call forth an elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Elemental Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
:
The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

#### Summon Greater Demon
*5th-level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 												:: 1 Action
**Mana Cost:**														:: 13 mana
**Range:**        												:: 60 Feet
**Components:**   												:: V,S,M (a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours)
**Duration:**     												:: Concentration, up to 1 Hour
**Magic Archetype Implementations:**			:: Wizard

You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a shadow demon or a barlgura. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
:
Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.
:
At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Persuasion Saving Throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points.
:
As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Mental Fortitude Saving Throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
:
An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
:
d10	Behavior

1	The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.
:
2-6	The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.
:

You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.
:
Gusts. A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

Downdraft. You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls.

:
Updraft. You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
:

You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

# Chapter IX: Combat

As with any game dependent on adventuring, there will be times when combat is necessary. This chapter will outline the rules surround combat within Natural Progressions

### Initiative

Turn order within combat is determined by a character's initiative. The roll needed for initiatve can vary depending on the context of combat.
:
For example, if the party is ambushing a group on the road, a stealth check should be used for initiative. Likewise, if the party is being ambushed, perception or reflex could be used. Generally speaking, initiative checks will be either a stealth, perception or reflex check, although other checks are possible.
:
#### Order of Violence

While in combat, the order is determined by each character's (or group's) initiative roll. Each character does not need to roll the same type of check when calculating the initative order - if it makes sense to have one character roll reflex when the rest are rolling perception, do it.

### Armor Class

Armor class is an abstraction of a character's ability to avoid injury, whether that be through the strength of armor or speed of their reactions. A character is able to avoid any damage if the attack roll (plus modifiers) is less than their armor class.
:
Your Armor class is calculated as: 10 + armor bonus + weapon bonus + shield bonus + reflex skill modifier. For a more in depth description, please refer to the Armor section in Chapter VI.

### Hit Points

Hit points represent a character's health and general physical well-being. They are are only regenerated on a rest. After a rest is completed, a character regains lost hit points up to their level + Constitution modifier.
:
A character's maximum hp can be calulated as follows:
:
11 + level * Constitution modifier + number of levels in Martial archetypes * Reflex modifier
:
This calculation does mean, assuming a maximum level of 11, and a maximum modifier of 11, all characters will have a maximum hp between 11 and 253.

#### Constitution and Reflex Increases

When a character's Constitution or Reflex modifier increases, their maximum hit points retroactively increase to use the new modifiers. Their current hit points would remain the same, however. 
:
For instance, if a level 5 Novitiate with 4 levels in Figher and 1 level in Wizard increases their Constitution modifier by 1, their maximum health would increase by 5. If they were at full health previously, they would be missing 5 hit points from their maximum after increases their maximum hit points.
:
Likewise, if that same level 5 Novitiate increased their Reflex modifier by 1, their maximum hit points would increase by 4. 

#### Hitting 0 Hit Points

When a character drops to 0 hitpoints, on their turn, they need to start making Death Saving Throws. There are no modifiers added to this roll. Roll a d20. On a roll of 1-10, you have accrued a failure, and on a roll of 11-20, you have made a success.
:
Upon 3 failures, your character dies. Upon 3 successes, your character has stabilized, but is unconscious for the duration of one rest. This unconsciousness cannot be broken by any non-magical means. After their rest, the character regains hit points equal to their level + Constitution modifier.
:
While rolling Death Saving Throws, your companions can attempt to make a DC 15 Medicine check to help stabilize you. Upon a success, you gain one success. Should you be healed while rolling Death Saving Throws, you are automatically stabilized, but you are still unconscious.
:
#### Temporary Hit Points

Some abilities and spells give creatures temporary hit points. These hitpoints are not counted towards your maximum hit points, and there is no limit as to how many temporary hit points you can have. Rather, they are a secondary health pool that will be drawn from first when taking damage.
:
Should you exit combat still retaining temporary hit points, they will last until the ability or spell that triggered them is over, or until you take a rest.

### Critical Hits

Critical hits represent's a character striking a creature in it's weak spot, dealing extra damage. A character scores a critical hit whenever they roll a natural 20 on the attack roll (which will also increase their attack modifier) or they roll at least 10 higher than the armor class of the target (including any modifiers on that roll).

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter IX: Combat | Rules }}

\page

When dealing damage from a critical hit, you roll your normal damage, but add an additional damage equal to the maximum damage you roll. For example, suppose a character with a +2 modifier to a short sword, and no other damage modifiers rolls a critical hit. Their damage would be 1d6 + 2 (from modifier damage) + 6 (from critical hit).

### Cover

During combat, can gain cover, protecting them from some attacks and damage. There are two tiers of cover: Half Cover and Full Cover.
:
**Half Cover**: A character or creature that has Half Cover has attacks rolled against them with disadvantage. The character or creature can still be seen, and can be targetted by spells and abilities that do not have an attack roll with no penalty.
:
**Full Cover**: A character or creature with Full Cover cannot be seen, and therefore cannot be targetted by attacks. Additionally, the character or creature has advantage on Saving Throws caused by any area of effects spells or abilities.
:
Both of these tiers are subject to the point of view of one creature as well as the application by the LM. For example, a creature hiding behind a wall from one party member would be considered to have Full Cover. But if there was a second party member who was behind this same wall, the creature would not have Full Cover according to the second party member's perspective.

### Surprise

By default, before the start of combat, both parties will notice each other. However, if one, or both, sides attempt to be stealthy and hide from the other party before launching their attack, it's possible that one party may not notice the other.
:
In these instances, the party attempting to be stealthy makes a Stealth check contested against each member's passive Perception (or an active Perception Saving Throw if the second party is suspicious). Any creature that fails their Perception check does not know the first party is present, and will be Stunned during the first round of combat.

### Conditions

In and out of combat, a character may be subject to various conditions. Unless otherwise specified, one condition will be cured upon completion of a rest. If a character has multiple conditions, the LM will inform the player what condition has been cured.

#### Blinded

 - If a creature does not have a sense that does not require vision, creatures making Saving Throws against area of effects caused by your spells and abilities do so with advantage.

#### Charmed

 - Upon completion of a rest, a creature will lose Exhausted III and gain Exhausted II.

### A Character's Turn

Each round, every character has 4 different parts of their turn: action, ability action, reaction and movement. Unless they are affected by something that allows them to take one part multiple times, each part can only be used once per round.

 - The action represents the primary activity that they are doing for this round of combat. Some standard actions are listed below.
 - Depending on your character's build, you may have access to spells or other abilties that are considered and ability action. Generally speaking, these abilities take less time to perform that an action.
 - The reaction represents a character's action upon another character performing a certain action. 
 - Movement, also referred as *speed*, is how far a character can move in once turn. This is based upon a character's race, and can differ depending on build and the effects a character hs.

## Actions

Below is a list of official actions. Note that this list is not exhaustive, so feel free to add and remove actions as you see fit.

### Attack

Make one melee or ranged attack. If you do not have a weapon currently equipped, you may draw as part of your action. When making an attack, roll a d20, add your weapon modifier in addition to any other modifiers you may have. If your attack roll is at equal or greater than the armor class of your target, your attack hits.
:
You then roll damage, and decrease the hit points of the target by the damage dealt (after resistances and vulnerabilities are applied).
:
If you have the Extra Attack class feature, you can make more attacks per action as defined by your class feature. If the weapon you are using has the Disarm, Entangle, Knockback or Trip property, you can choose to make an attack of the corresponding type. Refer to the property definitions in Chapter VI for the rules regarding these types of attacks.

#### Ranged Attacks

Ranged weapons, such as bows, have two specified ranges in which they are effective. The smaller range represents the range at which the weapon is most effective. The larger range represents the outside range at which a weapon can be used. Any attacks within this range are done so at disadvantage. If using a ranged weapon outside of the larger range, the attack automatically misses.
:
Additionally, when fighting with a ranged weapon, if there is an opponent within 5 ft of you, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls.

#### Two Weapon Fighting (Dual-Wielding)

When you are wielding two light weapons, or a weapon with the double-ended property, you can use your ability action to make an attack with your offhand weapon. You do not add your weapon skill bonus to the damage of this attack.

#### Flanking

By default, there are no modifiers applied to attack rolls due to flanking. As an *optional rule*, having multiple allies adjacent to a target yields attack bonuses.
:
When you have one ally ajacent to an enemy you are attacking, you gain +2 to all melee attack rolls against a target. When there are two or more allies ajacent to an enemy, you gain +5 to all melee attack rolls.

### Cast a Spell

Cast one spell with a casting time of one action (or less).

### Dash

When a character dashes, they gain movement equal to their current movement speed, after an modifiers are applied.
For example, if a character has a movement speed of 30 ft, taking the dash action gives them another 30 ft, for a total of 60 ft of movement for this round.

### Disengage

The disengage action allows a character to move outside the attack range of any character without provoking attacks of opportunity.

### Dodge

Taking the dodge action gives the character greater avoidance of attacks. While the character is conscious, any attack roll against the character, whether it be a melee, ranged or spell attack, is made at disadvantage. 

#### Grappling

On your turn, you can choose an adjacent opponent to grapple. Make an Athletics check contested against your target's Athletics or Reflex Saving Throw. If your check ties or beats your target's Saving Throw, your target gains the Restrained condition. You can choose if you are standing while grappling your opponent (such as a headlock), or if you have tackled them to the ground.
:
Your target is restrained until they take an action to pass a contested Athletics or Reflex check against your Athletics Saving Throw.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter IX: Combat | Actions }}

\page

### Help

During combat, you can use your action to aid another character in their next action. However this takes form should be decided by the player depending on the action that the other character is attempting. When taking this action, the other character gains advantage on their roll.

#### Shoving

On your turn, you can choose to shove an opponent. Make an Athletics check contested against your target's Athletics or Reflex Saving Throw. If your check ties or beats your target's Saving Throw by at most 4, you push your target back 5 ft. If your check beats your target's Saving Throw by at least 5, you have pushed your target to the ground.

### Use an Object

Generally speaking, using an object is already part of an action, such as drawing a weapon as part of an attack. However, if you with to use an object that that requires an action to use, take the Use an Object action and follow the action defined by the object.

### Use an Ability Action

As an action, you can choose to use one of your ability actions - as ability actions are generally shorter than actions, one can reasonably perform them in the time it would take to use an action. The one restriction is that you cannot use your action and ability action to perform the same ability action twice in one turn.

### Improvise an Action

The actions above will generally cover most actions that a character takes during combat. However, if there is something that you would like to do for your action that do not fit into the predefined rolls, confer with your dm as to how that would best work, and take the Improvise and Action action.

## Ability Actions

Generally speaking, all Ability Actions will be defined by a character's build. The only standard ability actions that all characters have access to is to make an Offhand Attack

### Offhand Attack

As described in the Two Weapon Fighting subsection, when a character is wielding two weapons with the light property, or one weapon with the double-ended property with two hands, you can use your Ability Action to make an attacks with your offhand weapon. You do not add your weapon ability modifier to the damage of this roll.

## Reactions

With the exception of Opportunity Attacks and Ready, there are no standard reactions that all characters will have. That being said, it is possible for a character to have more reactions depending on their build or magic items that they may have.

### Opportunity Attacks

When using a melee weapon and an opponent willingly moves out of your reach, you are able to use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity on the moving foe. You do not benefit from anything that gives you more than one attack per attack action when performing an attack of opportunity.
:
Additionally, if a character is moved against their will outside of your attack range, those movement does not cause opportunity attacks.

### Ready

Occasionally, a character may wish to hold their turn for certain circumstances to occur.
:
Describe the conditions on which your character is waiting. If those conditions occur before your next turn, your character may choose to perform their action. If the conditions do not occur, you lose your turn for this round.
:
When the prescribed conditions occur, you use your Reaction to perform your turn.

## Damage Types

Below is a listing of each of the damage types. Most damage types, with the exception of Force damage, have both a magic and non-magic version. Force damage is always magical. Resistances, unless otherwise specified, cover both magical and non-magical damage for the given type
:
**Acid**

Acid damage corrodes a creature, breaking it apart until nothing remains. Generally speaking, acid damage from a natural source is non-magical, and those from a spell is magical.
:
**Bludgeoning**

Bludegeoning damage is blunt force attacks. Bludeoning damage is almost always nonmagical, unless the weapon dealing it is magical.
:
**Cold**

The bitter cold can kill just about anything. Most sources that deal cold damage are magical, but natural sources, such as a blizzard, are not magical.

{{pageNumber,auto}}

\page
